principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) -\\natomicity, consistency, isolation, durability -\\nand supports server-side joins between multiple entities (tables).\\nInterestingly, in addition to this,\\nit also supports a JSON data type natively,\\nand provides a [rich set of functions and operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/functions-json.html)\\nto work with its `jsonb` type.\\n<sup name=\\\"post-content-location-jsonb\\\">[1](#post-footnote-location-jsonb)</sup>\\n\\nThe support for relational and document database paradigms is a potent combination,\\nas it is feasible to use PostgreSql as a\\n[document database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database) -\\none of the main categories of [NoSql databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL).\\nA pattern for doing this is to create tables with just two columns:\\n\\n- an `id` column that is the (indexed) primary key for the document, and\\n- a `body` column that is the document, and is of type `jsonb`\\n\\nHowever, operations on such documents can be quite tricky\\nin the context of relational database queries (SQL).\\nOne of these is that most operations are *upserts* (update-insert),\\nand these operations are not very common in relational databases,\\nwhich subscribe to the CRUD paradigm - create, read, update, delete.\\n*Upsert* is a two-in-one combination of both create and update operations.\\nI have previously written about\\n[*upserts* in PostgreSql](http://blog.bguiz.com/2017/postgresql-upsert-knex#post-content-location-document-pattern-postgres),\\nso check that out for a detailed example.\\n\\n## Modifying a document\\n\\nAnother piece of the puzzle is working out\\nwhat the updated copy of a document should be.\\n\\nSay you have a document that looks like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst original = {\\n\\tid: 123,\\n\\tbody: {\\n\\t\\ttitle: 'JSON merge in PostgreSql',\\n\\t\\tstats: {\\n\\t\\t\\tname: 'Brendan',\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t},\\n};\\n```\\n\\n... and specify a delta like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst delta = {\\n\\tbody: {\\n\\t\\tauthor: {\\n\\t\\t\\tname: 'Brendan Graetz',\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t},\\n};\\n```\\n\\n... and we wish to change it to become this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst modified = {\\n\\tid: 123,\\n\\tbody: {\\n\\t\\ttitle: 'JSON merge in PostgreSql',\\n\\t\\tauthor: {\\n\\t\\t\\tname: 'Brendan Graetz',\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t},\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIf you have used a document database before,\\nyou might recognise this pattern immediately.\\nFor example, in MongoDb, you could accomplish this using\\n[`collection.update()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.update/):\\n\\n```javascript\\ndb.collection.update({ _id: original.id }, delta, { upsert: true });\\n```\\n\\nWhen using PostgreSql, in a table with an `id` primary key column,\\nand a `body` document column,\\nhow would we go about accomplishing the same thing?\\n\\n## Application server 💻 modifies document: ❌ approach\\n\\nThe first approach which comes to mind\\nmight be to use your application server to modify the document.\\nThe steps might look something like this:\\n\\n- Server reads document from database\\n- Server modifies the document\\n- Server writes the modified document to the database\\n\\nThis would work fine if there was only ever one user using the system at a time,\\nand only one instance of this application server running.\\nHowever, in reality, no system has the luxury of running under such assumptions.\\nThe problems with the above approach include:\\n\\n- There are 2 round trips between the server\\n- Disk I/O needs to happen twice\\n- When multiple operations occur on the same document concurrently, the last one overwrites the first one\\n\\n### Concurrency + race to last write\\n\\nThe first two are somewhat forgivable,\\nas they are potential performance problems.\\nHowever, the last one means that you have potentially wrong data being written to your database,\\ndue to some sort of race condition occurring.\\nThis is somewhat similar to the\\n[cliched bank transaction processing scenarios](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=26890&seqNum=3).\\nThis article goes into greater depth regarding\\n[lost update scenarios](https://vladmihalcea.com/2014/09/14/a-beginners-guide-to-database-locking-and-the-lost-update-phenomena/).\\nA brief summary of this would be:\\n\\n- There an `account` entity that has the following fields: `id: 123, balance: 100`\\n- This particular account happens to receive a credit of `20`\\n  - Database query `select balance from user where id= 123;` returns `100`\\n  - Application server works out `100 + 20 = 120`\\n  - Database query `update user set balance = 120 where id = 123;`\\n- The same account also receives a debit of `10`\\n  - Database query `select balance from user where id= 123;` returns `120`\\n  - Application server works out `100 - 10 = 110`\\n  - Database query `update user set balance = 110 where id = 123;`\\n\\nThis approach works fine, except when both the credit and the debit come through at exactly the same time.\\nIf both `select` statements are executed before either `update` statement,\\nwe have a problem, because tboh select statements would return `100`,\\nand thherefore one of the `update` statements would attempt to set balance to `120` and `90` respectively,\\nneither of which are correct.\\n\\nThere are two ways to solve this problem:\\n\\n- Block updates to entity by other instances of application server until done\\n  - Use this when updates to the entity are complex,\\n    and it makes the most sense to do this on the application server.\\n  - In PostgreSql this can be achieved through\\n    row-level locking,\\n    `serializable` transactions, or\\n    optimistic locking.\\n    [Detailed explanation

composed out of functions and operators available on the database\\n\\nAn example of moving the update logic to the application server,\\ncontinuing with the same account balance example above:\\n\\n- There an `account` entity that has the following fields: `id: 123, balance: 100`\\n- This particular account happens to receive a credit of `20`\\n  - Database query `update user set balance = balance + 20 where id = 123;`\\n- The same account also receives a debit of `10`\\n  - Database query `update user set balance = balance - 10 where id = 123;`\\n\\nMuch cleaner!\\nMore importantly, the balance will be correct, even if both statments occur at the same time.\\n\\nThe logic for merging JSON can feasibly be moved to the database,\\nand that is the next approach that we will take a look at.\\nAfter all, when working with documents,\\nwe can still adhere to the same principles that we would for relational data.\\n\\n## Database 💾 modifies document: ✔️ approach\\n\\nAll of the problems identified above are rooted in having the application server\\nperform the modification of the document.\\nThankfully PostgreSql has a sufficiently full-featured set of operators that allows one to update JSON documents,\\nplus the ability to define and execute [functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/sql-createfunction.html)\\non the database itself.\\nSince these functions run within the database,\\nthe database manages the context of its execution.\\nTherefore it is able to continue providing its ACID principle guarantees.\\n\\nIn addition to fixing the problems identified earlier,\\nit also has a few other benefits:\\n\\n- More efficient by being compiled ahead of time\\n- As functions are defined in a central place,\\n  this lessens the chance of errors stemming from\\n  varied statements in different parts of the application server.\\n\\nNext, we shall take a look at defining such a function\\nthat is used to deep merge one JSON document into another.\\n\\n## Recursive merge\\n\\nWe start by defining a PostgreSql function.\\nIt is named `jsonb_merge_recurse`, and takes in two parameters.\\nBoth of the parameters are of type\\n[`jsonb`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/datatype-json.html),\\nwhere the left one is the `original` document,\\nand the right one is the `delta` document,\\nand its return value is the `modified` document.\\n\\nWe set the language to `sql`,\\nas it is possible to do do this purely using PostgreSql\\n[JSON functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/functions-json.html).\\nWe have the option of using a user-defined procedural language -\\nfor example, Javascript via [PLv8](https://github.com/plv8/plv8/blob/master/doc/plv8.md) -\\nif we wanted to, however, that is an exercise for another time!\\n\\n```sql\\ncreate or replace function jsonb_merge_recurse(orig jsonb, delta jsonb)\\nreturns jsonb language sql as $$\\n\\t/* ... */\\n$$;\\n```\\n\\nBetween the pair of `$$` delimiting the start and end of the function -\\nas we are using the `sql` language -\\nwe use a `select` statement.\\nThe result obtained from this select statement will be the return value of this function.\\nThe `from` and `full join` clauses of the select statement here\\nhave the effect of iterating through the outermost level of keys of the JSON object,\\nand joining on them when these keys are the same - `on keyOrig = keyDelta`.\\nThe values corresponding to these keys are extracted as well - `jsonb_each()`.\\n\\n```sql\\nselect\\n\\t/* ... */\\nfrom jsonb_each(orig) e1(keyOrig, valOrig)\\nfull join jsonb_each(delta) e2(keyDelta, valDelta) on keyOrig = keyDelta\\n```\\n\\nNext, we use the following functions:\\n\\n- [`coalesce()`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/functions-conditional.html#FUNCTIONS-COALESCE-NVL-IFNULL)\\n  returns the *first* of its arguments that is not `null`, or `null` when all arguments are `null`.\\n- [`jsonb_object_agg()`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-AGGREGATE-TABLE)\\n  aggregates key-value pairs as a JSON object\\n\\nHere `coalesce()` is used to use `keyOrig` when present, otherwise `keyDelta` is used,\\nand then `jsonb_object_agg` is used to create a `jsonb` object\\nwhose key is either `keyOrig` or `keyDelta` (as obtained from `coalesce()`),\\nand whose value comes from the result of the `case` statement.\\n\\nSince this function needs to employ recursion,\\nwe will also define the recursive case.\\nThis will occur when both values are themselves objects,\\nand therefore we need to drill down one level deeper.\\n\\n```sql\\njsonb_object_agg(\\n\\tcoalesce(keyOrig, keyDelta),\\n\\tcase\\n\\t\\t/* ... */\\n\\t\\telse jsonb_merge_recurse(valOrig, valDelta)\\n\\tend\\n)\\n```\\n\\nNext, we have the non-recursive cases.\\nWhen either value is `null`, we use the other one.\\nOtherwise, when either value is *not* an object,\\nwe use the delta value -\\nas the intent is for the original values to be\\noverridden by the delta values.\\n\\n```sql\\nwhen valOrig isnull then valDelta\\nwhen valDelta isnull then valOrig\\nwhen (jsonb_typeof(valOrig) <> 'object' or jsonb_typeof(valDelta) <> 'object') then valDelta\\n```\\n\\nThe `case` statement can be summarised with the following table:\\n\\n\\n| condition                                     | valOrig             | valDelta            | result     |\\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|\\n| `valOrig` is null                             | null                | primitive or object | `valDelta` |\\n| `valDelta` is null                            | primitive or object | null                | `valOrig`  |\\n| either `valOrig` or `valDelta` are primitives | primitive or object | primitive or object | `valDelta` |\\n| both `valOrig` and `valDelta` are objects     | object              | object              | (recur)    |\\n\\n\\nAssembling the above snippets together,\\nwe have the full function:\\n\\n```sql\\ncreate or replace function jsonb_merge_recurse(orig jsonb, delta jsonb)\\nreturns jsonb language sql as $$\\n\\tselect\\n\\t\\tjsonb_object_agg(\\n\\t\\t\\tcoalesce(keyOrig, keyDelta),\\n\\t\\t\\tcase\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen valOrig isnull then valDelta\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen valDelta isnull then valOrig\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen (jsonb_typeof(valOrig) <> 'object' or jsonb_typeof(valDelta) <> 'object') then valDelta\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse jsonb_merge_recurse(valOrig, valDelta)\\n\\t\\t\\tend\\n\\t\\t)\\n\\tfrom jsonb_each(orig) e1(keyOrig, valOrig)\\n\\tfull join jsonb_each(delta) e2(keyDelta, valDelta) on keyOrig = keyDelta\\n$$;\\n```\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\nNote that this will allow deep merging of any object into any other object,\\nso long as we treat arrays as primitives.\\nOf course, in some cases, we would want to do some special things with arrays.\\nFor example if the first value is an array, and the second is a primitive,\\nwe could append the primitive to the end of the array.\\nHowever these cases can be quite varied,\\nand these use cases would be better suited to having separate functions\\nspecific to array manipulation.\\n\\n## Thanks\\n\\nThanks to [Andrew](https://twitter.com/andy_snow) and

upsert, anyway?\\n\\nAn *upsert* is short for \\\"update or insert\\\" in the context of SQL statements for databases.\\n\\nThe typical use case for an upsert,\\nis when you have some data that needs to be in a row,\\nbut you are not sure if that row already exists -\\nbased on its primary key -\\nthen you would need to either insert a new row, *or*\\nupdate the existing row.\\n\\nHowever, *upsert* is not a command that was part of the\\n[SQL '99 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:1999),\\nand therefore many database vendors either do not support it,\\nor if they do support it, the query syntax for it can vary significantly\\n<sup name=\\\"post-content-location-various-db-upsert\\\">[0](#post-footnote-location-approaches-otherdb-upsert)</sup>\\n.\\n\\n## Sans explicit upsert support\\n\\nIf you wish to perform an \\\"insert or update\\\" in a scenario\\nthat is similar to the one described above, *but*\\nthe database that you are using does not support it,\\nwith some difficulty, you can achieve the same thing.\\n\\nIf, based on your application domain,\\ninserts are *more common* than updates:\\n\\n1. Perform an insert\\n2. If the insert failed because primary key already exists, perform an update\\n3.

If the update failed because primary key does not exist, perform an insert\\n3. Wrap the above in a transaction, so that the operation remains atomic\\n\\nBoth of the above are the same,\\nexcept for the order in which the insert and update operations are attempted.\\n\\n## Upsert in PostgreSql\\n\\nPostgres landed support for upsert in `9.5`,\\nso thankfully one does not need to deal with the above.\\nThey do not name it upsert though,\\ninstead it is done via an\\n[`insert`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/sql-insert.html) statement that uses\\nan [`on conflict`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/sql-insert.html#sql-on-conflict) clause.\\nAn excerpt from the documentation:\\n\\n> ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE guarantees an atomic INSERT or UPDATE outcome;\\n> provided there is no independent error,\\n> one of those two outcomes is guaranteed, even under high concurrency.\\n> This is also known as UPSERT — “UPDATE or INSERT”.\\n\\n## Knex raw statements\\n\\n[Knex](http://knexjs.org/) is a NodeJs database library\\nwhich performs 3 key functions:\\n\\n- Query building\\n- Migrations\\n- Connection and pool management\\n\\nIt is, however, important to stress that it is *not*\\nan [Object-Relational Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) library,\\neven though most ORMs typically provide these functions too.\\n<sup name=\\\"post-content-location-orm\\\">[1](#post-footnote-location-orm)</sup>\\n\\nKnex supports multiple database vendors,\\nincluding PostgreSql.\\nTherefore when using its query builder,\\nit only supports the commands that all of them have in common.\\nThis usually means anything that is part of SQL '99.\\nTherefore, upsert does not make the cut.\\n\\nThankfully, however, Knex does provide an \\\"escape hatch\\\" of sorts,\\nvia [`knex.raw()`](http://knexjs.org/#Raw):\\nwhich allows you to write raw SQL\\n<sup name=\\\"post-content-location-rawsql\\\">[2](#post-footnote-location-rawsql)</sup>.\\nForewarned, let us proceed to write a PostgreSql-specific command in Knex,\\nwhich does an upsert.\\n\\nSome readers out there might take it even further,\\nand think, if we are using raw statements,\\nwhy use Knex at all - why not interface with the database driver directly?\\nWe use Knex here mainly for the migrations and connection pooling which comes out of the box,\\nand the query building is a nice-to-have which we might as well use.\\nThat being said, if you are already doing connection pooling and database migrations\\nby interfacing directly with the database driver, or some other means,\\nsimply extract the SQL parts out in the following segments for the same effect.\\n\\n## Example of Upsert in Knex\\n\\nIn the application I have been working on,\\nan upsert was needed to insert or update rows in an `account` table.\\nThis account table consisted of only 2 columns:\\n\\n- `id` as a `string`, which is the primary key.\\n- `body` as a `jsonb`, which is for the rest of the account data\\n  <sup name=\\\"post-content-location-document-pattern-postgres\\\">[3](#post-footnote-location-document-pattern-postgres)</sup>.\\n\\n```javascript\\nknex.raw(\\n  `insert into account ( id, body ) as original\\n  values ( :id, :body::jsonb )\\n  on conflict ( id ) do update\\n  set body = jsonb_merge_recurse ( original.body::jsonb, excluded.body::jsonb )\\n  returning *`,\\n  { id, body }\\n)\\n```\\n\\nLet us break this statement down, into its constituent parts:\\n\\n```javascript\\nknex.raw(sqlStatement, { id, body })\\n```\\n\\nThis is Knex' way of using named parameters -\\nit substitutes in the values of `id` and `body`\\nwhere `:id` and `:body` are present in `sqlStatement`.\\nWhen Knex parses this,\\nit transforms this into `$1` and `$2` in the SQL string passed to PostgreSql,\\nso that you get proper parameterised queries.\\nDo *not* use ES6 string templates - or any other equivalent method -\\nto substitute the values in manually,\\nbecause that would leave this query *vulnerable* to SQL injection attacks.\\n\\n```sql\\ninsert into account ( id, body ) as original\\nvalues( :id, :body::jsonb )\\n```\\n\\nThis is a standard `insert` statement.\\nThe alias part (`as original`)\\nis needed here to reference the current value in the table row,\\nwhere it currently exists.\\nYou can name this what you want of course (does not have to be `original`),\\nso long as it matches the usage in the following parts of the statement.\\n\\nThe next segment turns it into an upsert.\\n\\n```sql\\non conflict ( id ) do update\\n```\\n\\nThe `on conflict` clause flags that this insert statement\\nis actually an *upsert*,\\nand therefore that it should check whether `id` *already exists*\\nin one of the rows in the `account` table.\\nIf it exists, it will attempt an `update` *instead of* an `insert`.\\nWhen defined in this manner, during query execution,\\nPostgreSql does not need to attempt an `insert` and if a failure occurs,\\nsubsequently attempt an `update`, as the literal reading of the query string syntax might imply.\\nInstead, it would need to do an index lookup on the primary key (`id`),\\nthen know immediately which of `insert` or `update` needs to happen.\\n\\n```sql\\nset body = jsonb_merge_recurse ( original.body::jsonb, excluded.body::jsonb )\\n```\\n\\nHere we are updating the `body` as we would in a standard `update` statement.\\n<sup name=\\\"post-content-location-jsonbmergerecurse\\\">[4](#post-footnote-location-jsonbmergerecurse)</sup>.\\n\\nOf particular note, is `excluded`,\\nwhich is a special keyword that refers to the *new values*\\nin the row that would have been inserted if this had not become an update.\\nThis is mentioned in passing in the\\n`alias` and `conflict_action` action sections of the\\n[`on conflict`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/sql-insert.html#sql-on-conflict)\\nsection of PostgreSql's documentation\\n<sup name=\\\"post-content-location-postgresql-onconflict-docs\\\">[5](#post-footnote-location-postgresql-onconflict-docs)</sup>.\\n\\n`original` is the alias which we defined earlier,\\nand refers to the *previous values*\\nin the row in the table which matches the `id`,\\nas specified previously in `on conflict ( id )`.\\nSo the values are the values prior to this statement being executed.\\n<sup name=\\\"post-content-location-original-and-excluded\\\">[6](#post-footnote-location-original-and-excluded)</sup>.\\n\\n```sql\\nreturning *\\n```\\n\\nIn both `update` and `insert` statements,\\nthe returned output from the database is normally\\nthe number of rows that have been affected.\\nIn this case, we are always expecting this value to be `1`, because:\\n\\n- If there was no row with the specified `id` before, there is a new *one* now\\n- If there was an existing row with the specified `id` before, the same *one* is still there\\n\\nThat is *not* very useful.\\nSince it is an upsert,\\nwe care about what the new value for `body`\\nin this particular one row is *after* the statement is executed.\\nTherefore we use `returning *` to get the entire row back.\\n\\nThis is, of course, optional -\\nif you do not need to use this information,\\nand only care whether your query has succeeded or not,\\nyou can omit this,\\nand shave off a few bytes of network traffic\\nbetween the database and the server.\\n\\n## When you should use upserts\\n\\nIf you have an action where the entity you need to write to\\nmay or may not already exist at that point.\\nIn other words,\\nwhen the business logic of the application\\nhas no clear *demarcation of separate operations* for create and update operations,\\nan upsert is the perfect use case for this.\\n\\nIf the database you are using provides built in support for upserts,\\nit is certainly a great idea to use that\\ninstead of a hand rolled solution\\nusing separate `update` and `insert` statements wrapped in a transaction,\\nfor performance reasons.\\nNot to mention that the database can provide a stronger guarantee of adherence to\\n[ACID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)\\nthan custom SQL transactions can.\\n\\n## Footnotes\\n\\n<b name=\\\"post-footnote-location-various-db-upsert\\\">0</b>\\nSupport for upsert, or upsert-like, statements in various databases:\\n- `merge` statements

`sinon`,\\nI have migrated a very large numbers of tests over to Jest recently.\\nThere were several hard-won lessons along the way,\\nwhich requires one to change the way one approaches writing tests,\\nand even thinking about tests.\\n\\nJest is the new kid on the block,\\nwith other Javascript test frameworks being around for much longer.\\nThe value proposition of Jest is very strong though,\\nand it is worth considering.\\nThis post will highlight several contrasting concepts learnt as part of this process.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that Jest, presently,\\nis predominantly used to test in-browser Javascript,\\nin particular web applications written using ReactJs -\\nas both Jest and ReactJs are developed by the same company.\\nWhile it is engineered to work very well when testing ReactJs,\\nit is worth noting that it is, in its own right,\\na very versatile framework.\\nThis post explores this \\\"general\\\" use case for Jest,\\nin the context where a NodeJs API server is the test target.\\n\\n### Library vs framework\\n\\nJest is not a testing library, but a framework.\\nIt is an all in one.\\nLet's compare \\\"test stacks\\\":\\n\\nMy previous stack:\\n\\n- Test Runner: [`mocha`](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha)\\n- Assertions: [`chai`](https://github.com/chaijs/chai)\\n- Mocks: [`sinon`](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon)\\n- Time: [`lolex`](https://github.com/sinonjs/lolex) (via sinon)\\n\\nMy new testing stack:\\n\\n- Test Runner: [`jest`](https://github.com/facebook/jest)\\n- Assertions: [`jest`](https://github.com/facebook/jest)\\n- Mocks: [`jest`](https://github.com/facebook/jest)\\n- Time: [`jest`](https://github.com/facebook/jest)\\n\\nJest wears many hats at the same time.\\n\\n### Asynchronous tests\\n\\nWhat does `done()` do?\\n\\nIn `jasmine`, unlike in mocha, `done()` only signifies that a test is done.\\nIn `mocha`, if the first argument is defined, the test fails, e.g. `done(err)`.\\nJest uses `jasmine` as the test runner under the hood by default, the test will pass.\\nSolution: Split `done(err)` into an `expect(...)` followed by `done()`.\\n\\nJest also allows you to write tests as `async` functions,\\nhowever `async` functions can only `await` on `Promise`s.\\nMy code base makes use of error-first callbacks as its primary asynchronous Javascript mechanism,\\nso I have not explored this much;\\nbut worth pointing out for those of you who are writing tests for `Promise`s.\\n\\n### Mocks\\n\\nIn `mocha` and `jasmine`, it is common to use `sinon` for spies, stubs, and mocks.\\nFor best results in Jest, use the built in `jest.fn()` and `jest.fn().mockImplementation()`.\\nThis is actually a boon for\\n[mocking objects with chained APIs](http://blog.bguiz.com/2017/mocking-chained-apis-jest),\\nwhich I have written about previously.\\n\\n### Time\\n\\nIn `mocha` & `jasmine`, it is common to use `lolex` (via `sinon`) to fake timers.\\nIn Jest, this doesn't play well. Use a combination of `mockdate` (for `Date`),\\nand Jest's built in `jest.runTimersToTime(ms);` (for `setTimeout` and pals)\\n`jest.runAllTicks();` (for `Promise`s, as well as `nextTick` and pals).\\n\\nThis might seem like a lot of redundant code for time related events,\\nat least compared to the `clock.tick(ms)` syntax common in `sinon`.\\nMost of the time it is.\\nHowever, in some cases you can actually split them up,\\nand do assertions in between.\\nDon't expect to do this very often though -\\nI have thus far only needed to do this twice.\\n\\n### Watch\\n\\nIn `mocha` & `jasmine`, it is common to use `describe.only()`, `it.only()` and pals to narrow down which tests get run.\\nIn Jest, invoke the test script using the `--watch` CLI flag,\\nand after the process has started,\\nhit `p` (for pattern) on the keyboard,\\nand type a regular expression to filter by test file name.\\n\\nTake note that Jest persists the filter,\\nso when you kill the test process, and restart it,\\nthe previous filter is still intact\\n(only for `--watch` mode).\\nTo clear the filter,\\nhit `a` (for all) on the keyboard.\\n\\n### Multiple test scenarios\\n\\nIn larger projects,\\nyou may have different sets of tests\\nwhich you wish to run in different scenarios,\\ne.g. complete set of tests vs smoke tests.\\n In these scenarios,\\n you would conceivably wish to not just choose which test files to run,\\n but also change several other options.\\n In this case,\\n it might be easier to configure multiple test commands in `package.json`,\\n e.g. `test` and `test-smoke`,\\n then put the config for each of them in JSON files,\\n and point to them using the `--config` CLI flag.\\n\\nFor example, given the following folder

unit tests using the following command,\\nwhich you would place in the `scripts` section of `package.json`.\\n\\n```\\njest --config ./jest-config-unit.json\\n```\\n\\n(and run additional commands, pointing to their respective files, for integration tests and smoke tests)\\n\\n### Sand boxing\\n\\nIn `mocha` & `jasmine`,\\nany side effects introduced from a test will carry over from one test to the next.\\n\\nIn Jest, you don't have to clean up anything that\\nis in memory in the `node` process\\nbecause that is completely sandboxed;\\nbut you still need to clean up anything that is external to this,\\ne.g. file system, database, etc.\\nBetter yet, where possible,\\nmock these externals so that it truly stays all in memory.\\n\\n### DRY and DAMP\\n\\nIn mocha/ jasmine,\\n you would write your tests such that they were DAMP\\n(opposite of DRY: do not repeat yourself).\\nThe repetition is considered good in this case,\\nbecause it enables the tests to be\\nself-contained description of the features being tested.\\n\\nIn Jest, you can write your test code in a DRY manner,\\nwhile still maintaining the descriptiveness,\\nby making use of *snapshots*\\nto capture the variations and differences between each test.\\n\\nThis is especially useful when you are testing variations\\nof calling the same code multiple times in a sequence,\\nand other scenarios where there are iterations.\\n\\nThe main *caveat* of this approach is resultant from the fact that\\nyou are not crafting the assertions by hand\\n(the contents of each snapshot),\\nand instead, it is all automatically generated for you.\\nThis requires greater discipline on the part of you as a developer\\nto *read through the snapshots* in nitpick-level detail,\\nand verify that you are indeed asserting\\nwhat you should be asserting.\\n\\nUsed properly, snapshots can be an enormous boon to testing,\\nallowing one to write and update tests quickly,\\nmaking iterations faster.\\n\\nOne more tip regarding snapshots:\\nDon't `expect(result).toMatchSnapshot(...)` directly.\\nInstead transform the result object to strip out the parts of it that aren't important to test,\\nand add additional bits of meta data about the test -\\nthink, \\\"what would I want to `console.log(...)` here?\\\" -\\nand then do the snapshots on *that* object.\\n\\n### All the docs\\n\\nJest has rather good documentation -\\nevery one of its exposed APIs are documented somewhere on its website.\\nThat being said, Jest is a test runner,\\nand assertions library,\\na mocks library,\\nand a time library,\\nall rolled into one.\\nTherefore, the surface area of its API is huge.\\nThis is problematic for documentation,\\nbecause it can be quite hard to find things -\\nthings that you know should be in there somewhere,\\nbut are just not sure where to look.\\n\\nThis [handy reference](https://dmitriiabramov.github.io/jest-cheatsheet/index.html)\\ndeep links to all of the Jest API & CLI in one page,\\nand I have found this tremendously useful.\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/2017/mocking-chained-apis-jest\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"title\": \"Mocking Chained APIs in Jest\",\n

which is only a test runner.\\n`mocha`, on the other hand, has assertions, mocking,\\nand all the other bells and whistles, all baked in.\\nWith `mocha`, you would need to `require()` these in,\\nfrom other modules - my go to ones were `chai` and `sinon`.\\nFurther to this, `jest` adds snapshot testing,\\nwhich is something I have not previously done in `mocha` -\\nthat is perhaps something for a another article.\\n\\nSuffice to say that `jest` testing covers a huge surface area.\\nHere we will focus on just one aspect of it - mocking.\\nIn particular, mocking chained APIs.\\n\\n## Chained API\\n\\nA large part of the code that I am presently writing,\\nand therefore also testing,\\nhappens to be `express` middleware/ end points.\\nFor this asserting the API response is crucial,\\nand a typical usage of it looks like this:\\n\\n```js\\nres.status(200).json({ foo: 'bar' });\\n```\\n\\nA chained API is one which returns the original object,\\nrather than the result of the operation,\\nfrom each function call.\\nWhile this might be counter intuitive\\n(why not just return the result?)\\nit does result in a rather easy way to invoke multiple\\nfunction on the same, possibly mutable, object.\\nFrom an implementor's point of view,\\nit is a very quick way to sort of create a\\n[DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).\\n\\n## Split mock definition from mock implementation\\n\\nAn object which exposes a chained API is\\ngreat for both its implementor,\\nand its consumer...\\nbut not so great for someone who wishes to mock it for testing purposes.\\n\\nIn `jest`,\\n[`jest.fn(implementation)`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/jest-object.html#jestfnimplementation)\\nallows one to create a mock function with an custom implementation.\\nMocking a chained API using this alone is an impossible venture.\\nDig a little deeper into the docs, however,\\nand you will find that you can do\\n[`jest.fn().mockImplementation(implementation)`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/mock-function-api.html#mockfnmockimplementationfn).\\nYou might notice that that in itself adheres to my prior definition of a chained API,\\nas `.fn()` returns a mock function,\\nand it is missing any implementation,\\nso it simply defaults to a no-op function.\\nSubsequently we call `.mockImplementation(ourOwnImpl)`.\\nThis time it contains our own implementation,\\nwhich supersedes the previous no-op implementation,\\nsince `jest` mock functions are mutable.\\nIn fact, if we were to subsequently do so again,\\n`.mockImplementation(ourSecondImpl)`,\\nour second implementation would supersede our previous one.\\n\\nNow, in a neat-o little trick,\\nwe are going to use a chained API to test another chained API:\\n\\n```js\\nlet res;\\nlet resSet;\\nlet resStatus;\\nlet resJson;\\n\\nfunction setUpExpressMocks () {\\n\\t\\tresJson = jest.fn();\\n\\t\\tresStatus = jest.fn();\\n\\t\\tresSet = jest.fn();\\n\\t\\tres = {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tset: resSet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatus: resStatus,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjson: resJson,\\n\\t\\t};\\n\\t\\tresJson.mockImplementation(() => res);\\n\\t\\tresStatus.mockImplementation(() => res);\\n\\t\\tresSet.mockImplementation(() => res);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn order to do so however,\\nwithout incurring a lot of test code bloat,\\nwe will not use `jest`'s chained API as a chained API,\\nbut rather break it up,\\nand store the intermediate result in a variable.\\nIn between part one and part two,\\nwe create the return object,\\nthat is to be returned by all mock the mocked functions,\\nin order to have them all be part of a chained *and* mocked API.\\n\\n## In a `jest` Testing\\n\\n```js\\ndescribe('[test an express res]' => () {\\n\\n\\t// define setUpExpressMocks and the variables it uses over here\\n\\n\\tbeforeAll(setUpExpressMocks);\\n\\n\\tit('should test res with default mocks', () => {\\n\\t\\t// Do assertions right away\\n\\t\\t// expect() ...\\n\\t});\\n\\n\\tit('should test res with .json() override', (done) => {\\n\\t\\tresJson.mockImplementation((json) => {\\n\\t\\t\\t// Do assertions within overridden mock implementation\\n\\t\\t\\t// expect() ...\\n\\t\\t\\treturn res; // don't break the API chain\\n\\t\\t});\\n\\t});\\n});\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Well designed APIs\\n\\nKudos to the `jest` team for designing the APIs in this manner.\\nI do not know if it was by accident, or by intent,\\nbut being able to split the creation of a mock function\\nfrom setting its implementation\\nwas a major win when it came to mocking chained APIs.\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/2017/postgres-many2many-sql-non-relational\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"title\": \"PostgreSql Many-to-Many with Non-relational SQL\",\n

of these can be mitigated through various optimisations,\\nsuch as composite keys, indices on composite keys, SQL hints, et cetera;\\nbut are these really the only way?\\nIn a pure *relational database* system,\\nthat might be the extent of the surface area to be explored.\\n\\nHowever, PostgreSql supports some additional complex data types as well,\\nakin to those found in a *document database* system\\n(which overlaps with, and most times referred to as, \\\"NoSql\\\" database systems).\\nThe ones that are of particular interest are `Array`, `JSONB` array, `JSONB` object, and `hstore`.\\nThese complex data types can be utilised creatively to avoid multiple joins,\\nor even supplanting joins altogether.\\n\\nThe objective here is to explore:\\n\\n* Whether each of these complex types opens up a new means of storing, retrieving, and updating.\\n  many-to-many relationships in a database\\n* Whether they can support the range of operations required.\\n* How performant they are in supporting each of the required operations.\\n\\n## Summary of approaches\\n\\n* Junction table\\n  * Pure relational approach, where a `subject_student` table is created to store the relationships.\\n  * This is the \\\"classic\\\" approach\\n* `Array`\\n  * [`Array` data type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/arrays.html)\\n  * [`Array` functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-array.html)\\n  * Only single-dimensional arrays are considered.\\n* `JSONB` object and array\\n  * [`JSON` and `JSONB` data type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/datatype-json.html)\\n  * [`JSON` and `JSONB` functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/functions-json.html)\\n  * In PostgreSql, JSON can be represented using either `JSON` or `JSONB` types -\\n    we will only be considering the latter\\n  * JSON can represent complex nested documents, and so only a subset of its features are necessary\\n  * Need to consider both `JSONB` arrays, as well as `JSONB` objects (where only keys are used)\\n* `hstore`\\n  * [`hstore` data type and functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/hstore.html)\\n  * `hstore` is a hash map data structure of key-value pairs.\\n  * The consideration is that we will be using them such that only keys are used,\\n    in the sense that we only care whether a key has been set,\\n    and its value does not matter.\\n\\nBy reviewing the descriptions of these data types,\\nand the big-O notation of the algorithmic complexities of the operations\\nperformed on each of these types,\\nit is possible to foresee some of the challenges.\\nIn arrays (applying to both `Array` and `JSONB` array),\\nthere would be an anticipated challenge in insertion and removal of\\nelements by value rather than by index.\\nIn `JSONB` objects, the keys need to be strings,\\ntherefore there could be an additional performance penalty for type conversions per operation.\\nAs a `hstore` is a hash map,\\nit would appear ideal for the required operations,\\nbased on algorithmic complexity,\\nhowever, it would have a higher constant cost overheads for memory,\\nand processing overheads for hash computation and collision resolution,\\nand thus might need to get to far larger data sets before\\nit is able to outperform arrays.\\n\\nThe above are all inferences, of course,\\nand there are many more that we could possibly make.\\nThus there is a need for some some sample implementations\\nto validate/ invalidate them.\\n\\n## Implementation\\n\\n### Entities and Relations\\n\\nFor the purpose of this example, we shall model the following two entities:\\n\\n* Subject\\n* Student\\n\\nTheir relationship has many-to-many cardinality:\\n\\n* each student may study `0..*` subjects, and\\n* each subject has `0..*` students enrolled in it.\\n\\nWe shall design these entities as generic as possible -\\nthe minimum viable entity in order to demonstrate\\nmany-to-many relationship operations.\\nThus each will only have an integer `id` primary key column,\\nand a string `name` column.\\nApart from this each entity may have an additional column\\nfor storing its relationship to the other entity.\\n\\n### Database initialisation\\n\\nThe following assumes a PostgreSql `v9.6` installation.\\n\\nFirst create the database and a role to access it with.\\nSubstitute the names of each to your preference.\\n\\n```bash\\npsql\\n```\\n\\n```sql\\ndrop database if exists scratch;\\ndrop role if exists scratch;\\ncreate role scratch login encrypted password 'scratch' valid until 'infinity';\\ncreate database scratch with encoding 'UTF-8' owner='scratch' connection limit=1;\\n\\n-- list roles\\nselect * from pg_catalog.pg_shadow;\\n\\n-- list databases\\n\\\\list\\n\\n\\\\q\\n```\\n\\nNext, enable the `hstore` extension,\\nwhich comes bundled in most PostgreSql distributions,\\nby default.\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo su ${USER} -c \\\\n\\n  \\\"psql -d scratch -c 'create extension if not exists hstore;'\\\"\\npsql -d scratch -U scratch -W\\n```\\n\\n### Junction table approach\\n\\nSet up junction tables\\n\\n```sql\\n-- remove any existing tables\\ndrop table if exists junction_student_subject;\\ndrop table if exists junction_student;\\ndrop table if exists junction_subject;\\n\\n-- create tables\\ncreate table junction_student (\\n\\tid serial PRIMARY KEY,\\n\\tname text NOT NULL\\n\\t);\\ncreate table junction_subject (\\n\\tid serial PRIMARY

table\\n\\n```sql\\n-- given a student $1 and a subject $2, enrol student in the subject\\ninsert into junction_student_subject (student_id, subject_id)\\n\\tvalues ($1, $2);\\n```\\n\\nDelete related

jsonbarr_student;\\n\\n-- create tables\\ncreate table jsonbarr_student (\\n\\tid serial PRIMARY KEY,\\n\\tname text NOT NULL,\\n\\tsubject_ids jsonb DEFAULT '[]'\\n\\t);\\ncreate table

systems\\nhas always been an *implementation pain point*,\\nas well as a *performance bottleneck*.\\nThis has been an interesting exercise in exploring\\nthe different ways in which one can apply complex data types\\nto this problem.\\nOf the five different approaches considered -\\none \\\"classic\\\" junction table approach,\\nplus four approaches using complex data types -\\nfour of them appear to be feasible.\\nOnly the `JSONB` arrays approach,\\nwhich seemed plausible initially,\\ndoes not appear to be implementable.\\nThis is a great testament to the power of PostgreSql,\\nand its ability to span and leverage *both* relational\\nand non-relational approaches in database management.\\n\\nWe are not done just yet!\\n\\nThus far we have merely defined the schema and queries\\nfor specifying many-to-many relationships using various approaches.\\nThe natural next step would be to explore them in more detail.\\nThis includes procedurally generating data sets of different sizes for each of the entities,\\nincluding defining relationships linking the different entities together\\nwith various proportions of balanced and imbalanced cardinality.\\nAfter that is done, we should consider performance aspects of the various approaches too.\\nWe should explore the performance optimisations\\nwhich are feasible and appropriate for each approach;\\nand also explore how adding referential integrity constraints impact performance.\\nPerformance needs to be measured, of course,\\nwhich involves designing and running a benchmark.\\n\\nWatch this space!\\n\"\n      },\n

while:\\nThe *cognitive* part!\\n\\nThe tools that I had been using:\\n\\n- JIRA\\n- Pen and notebook\\n- Pen and sticky notes\\n- Text files on my hard disk(s)\\n- Text files with some sort of cloud sync (git, Dropbox etc)\\n\\nNone of these worked, either in isolation,\\nor when used together in various combinations.\\nThe problem was that there was too much of a barrier\\nbetween light-bulb moment, and\\nstoring those ideas somewhere.\\n\\n![Lightbulb -> Hurdle -> Brain](/images/posts/lightbulb-hurdle-brain.png)\\n\\nThe hurdle was too large.\\nThe solution was to use just one tool.\\nThis tool should simply get out of your way by being ridiculously easy to to use,\\nthat there would be no excuses to avoid capturing any idea.\\nRemove the friction/ barriers,\\nand ideas stand a better chance of getting to where they need to be.\\n\\n![Y U NO make me think?](/images/posts/y-u-no-make-me-think.png)\\n\\nPrior to commencing a project,\\nthere will be lots of ideas that need to be taken down in quick bursts,\\nand they will be endlessly shuffled and edited.\\nThat is a *high flux* scenario,\\nand I found Trello ideal for this.\\n\\n## Script the export\\n\\nTrello didn't get in the way when I was machine gunning\\nidea after idea (keyboard shortcuts for the win!),\\nand it had a user interface which simply allowed you to drag\\nstuff around anywhere you felt like it to rearrange and reorganise.\\n\\nSo, no dramas there ... but management uses *Excel*.\\n\\n![Yay not yay](http://gif-finder.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sarah-Hyland-Yay.gif)\\n\\n(Nitpick: *My* management is happy to use Trello as well,\\nbut they still need to use Excel to communicate with the rest of management.)\\n\\nSo, scrap all of the above, and plan project in Excel instead right?\\n\\nWrong, because *I am devloper*. This fella knows what I'm talking about:\\n\\n[![https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/477397164453527552/uh2w1u1o.jpeg](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/477397164453527552/uh2w1u1o.jpeg)](https://twitter.com/iamdevloper)\\n\\nInstead, I wrote a script that converts Trello's exported JSON\\ninto an Excel spreadsheet:\\n\\n[trello2charts](https://github.com/bguiz/trello2charts)\\n\\nIt is heavily customised to the particular way in which I like to use Trello,\\nwhich is to use the following entities to achieve a three-level hierarchy:\\nLists -> Cards -> Checklist Items\\n\\nFeel free to use it too, if this approach is compatible with yours.\\n\\nThis script enabled me to use a much better tool for the job,\\nand export to the required format whenever necessary.\\n\\n## Validation\\n\\nManagement's response to Excel spreadsheet:\\n\\n![Skeletor approves!](/images/posts/skeletor-approves.png)\\n\\n## In summary\\n\\n1.

 },\n        \"body\": \"\\nAfter managing an extremely large scale NodeJs deployment last year.\\nI learnt a great deal about production deployments with a focus on scalability.\\nThe retrospective summary of these learning points are in a presentation given last year:\\n[Top 7 Things Learnt Deploying NodeJs Servers at Scale](http://blog.bguiz.com/presentations/nodejs-servers-at-scale/).\\n\\nProduction deployments are about a whole lot more than *scalability* though,\\nand we'll examine another aspect of them here:\\nManaging multiple deployment environments.\\n\\n## What are deployment environments anyway?\\n\\nTo get to a *production deployment*,\\nyou will need intermediate deployments,\\nand to get to those *intermediate deployments*,\\nyou will need a *local deployment*.\\n\\nDeployment environments are different computers where\\na project can run.\\nFacilitating that, however, is *tricky business*!\\n\\n### Local deployment environment\\n\\nA local deployment is the one that a developer runs on their own computer,\\nwhile writing code, debugging it, et cetera.\\nA project would normally only need *one* of these.\\n\\nSome typical names: `localhost`, `127007`.\\n\\n### Intermediate deployment environments\\n\\nIntermediate deployments are those that are not customer facing,\\nbut are also not running on any developer's machines.\\nUsually these are run on CI/ CD servers (or provisioned by them).\\nA project would normally have *several* of these.\\n\\nSome typical names: `dev`, `staging`, `pentest`, `loadtest`.\\n\\n### Production deployment environment\\n\\nA production deployment is one that is customer facing,\\nso an actual customer of your business is going to hit this service,\\nmeaning that any downtime could mean that your business loses money.\\nTherefore the acceptable downtime is zero -\\nor, *practically*, as close to zero as you can possibly manage.\\nA project would normally have *one* of these.\\n\\nSome typical names: `live`, `production`.\\n\\n### `NODE_ENV`\\n\\nThe categorisation above *does not* imply\\nthe value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.\\nThough the similar name might make it seem so,\\nthey are indeed *different concepts*.\\nThe value of `NODE_ENV` determines the optimisation level under which\\nthe `node` binary executes the code.\\nAdditionally, many NodeJs libraries also do their own optimisations\\nbased on the value of `NODE_ENV`.\\n\\nHere are example profiles of an `express` server running\\nwithout `production`, then with `production`:\\n\\n![Flame graph of express with NODE_ENV set to anything else, and production](https://dt-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/localhost_3000_burst1_html-600x288.png)\\n\\nRead the full article for a more in-depth explanation:\\n[The drastic effects of omitting NODE_ENV in your Express.js applications](https://www.dynatrace.com/blog/the-drastic-effects-of-omitting-node_env-in-your-express-js-applications/).\\n\\nTherefore in the example above, we would want to have the\\n`live` deployment run with `NODE_ENV=production` (no surprises here).\\nAlso, we might want the `pentest` and `loadtest` deployments\\nrun with `NODE_ENV=production` as well,\\nbecause we want those performance optimisations in place,\\neven though they fall into the category of intermediate deployments.\\nThus, we quickly see the value of keeping\\nthe concepts of what *production* means separate:\\nWhen thinking about our deployment environments,\\nversus when thinking about what the value of `NODE_ENV` should be.\\n\\n## Task runner\\n\\nWhen you have a NodeJs project,\\nmore often than not, you will have several tasks that you do often enough,\\nand the standard practice for these is to standardise them -\\nespecially important in a collaborative development scenarios\\nsuch as open source, and in-house development teams.\\n\\n`npm`, the de facto package manager for NodeJs projects,\\nprovides a handy way to do this via `npm run someTask`,\\nwhere `someTask` is specified within `package.json`,\\nin the `scripts` section.\\n\\nThis is quite handy for simple tasks -\\nwhere there are no environment variables involved,\\nand where the task is always the same no matter which deployment it is being run on.\\nHowever, when a project approaches a certain level of complexity,\\nsome of its tasks will need to vary based on the deployment environment,\\nand they will need to make use of environment variables.\\nThis is where `cross-env` and `better-npm-run` come in.\\nThey are NodeJs libraries that are designed to augment `npm run`\\nallowing you to overcome those two initial hurdles.\\n\\n## Additional hurdles\\n\\nAs a project becomes even more complex,\\nyou might encounter some extra hurdles\\nrelated to deployment in different environments.\\n\\n### Variable substitution\\n\\n* You might need to substitute the value of an environment variable into another one\\n* You might need to substitute the value of an environment variable into the command\\n\\n### Different configuration files\\n\\n* You might need to load different sets of configuration files based on the deployment environment\\n\\n### Different tasks\\n\\n* You might need to run a completely different command for a particular task based on the environment\\n  * For example `localhost` might need to run a server via `nodemon`, whereas the other environments might need to run the server via `node` directly\\n\\n### Sub-environments\\n\\n* You might need to define environments hierarchically rather than as a flat list\\n* You might have ad-hoc environments that are spun up, created dynamically by CI/ CD\\n\\n## Introducing `erun`\\n\\nThe name is a contraction of *environment runner*.\\n\\n`erun` is an implementation that implements all of the\\nrequirements listed above -\\nand was created to scratch the proverbial itch,\\nafter running into all of these scenarios.\\n\\nHead over to the [erun project

Testing starter/ reference project\\\")\\n\\n## Testing NodeJs vs Testing Front-end\\n\\nWhen developing a NodeJs application,\\ntesting it can be quite straight forward,\\nin the sense that you simply need to to interact one thing:\\nyour *Javascript modules*.\\n\\nThis is fairly easy to do if your test runner or framework\\nis also written in NodeJs -\\nall you have got to do is `require()` the necessary modules in,\\nanything from an individual function to the entire application,\\nand run your tests against them.\\n\\nIt is not quite so simple with front-end Javascript,\\nbecause there is an *additional* thing that you have to deal with:\\n*the browser*.\\n\\nIt does not suffice to point your test runner or framework\\nat your Javascript modules and expect them to run.\\nInevitably, they'll need access to\\n`window`, `document`, a `DOMElement` of some variety,\\nor any number of other things that only a browser would give you access to.\\n\\n## Browser-based Test Runners\\n\\nThe solution to the problem above is to use test runners which\\nhave browser capabilities.\\nThat is, the test runner is able to start and stop browsers that are installed\\non the local system (or even on remote ones),\\nand run test cases within the browser while they are open.\\n\\nThis way, you can test your front-end Javascript code\\nin an *actual browser* environment.\\n\\nIn any type of software testing,\\nthere are two paradigms:\\nthere are unit tests, and there are integration tests.\\nDifferent browser-based test runners lend themselves more naturally\\nto each of these paradigms,\\nand we'll take a look at those next.\\n\\n## Unit Testing using Karma\\n\\nUnit testing is sometimes referred to as white-box testing.\\n\\nIt is where you do not concern yourself with\\nthe overall application,\\nbut rather the individual bits and pieces used to build the application.\\nThe focus here is on testing individual methods and functions,\\nand getting very specific on on how each of them perform in isolation.\\nTesting each unit of software,\\nhence the name *unit testing*.\\n\\n[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/)\\nis a browser-based test runner\\nthat is very well suited to doing unit testing.\\n\\n## Integration testing using WebdriverIO\\n\\nIntegration testing is sometimes referred to as black-box testing.\\n\\nIt is where you do not concern yourself with\\nthe individual bits and pieces used to build the application,\\nbut rather the overall application.\\nThe focus here is on testing the application as a whole,\\nsimilar to how an end-user might interact with your application.\\nTesting the how the entire software works together,\\nhence the name *integration testing*.\\n\\n[Webdriver.io](https://webdriver.io/)\\nis a browser-based test runner\\nthat us very well suited to doing integration testing.\\n\\n## Starter/ Reference Project\\n\\nI have put together a trivial front-end Javascript application.\\nIt has two buttons,\\nand pressing each one of them results in a different piece of text\\ngetting put on the screen.\\n(When I said trivial, I meant *trivial*).\\n\\nThe intent was, of course,\\nnot the application itself,\\nbut rather to expose the mechanics of testing it,\\nand to that end, it is sufficient.\\n\\nThe complete project,\\nincluding the setup and config for both Karma and WebdriverIO,\\nand sample unit tests and sample integration tests\\nare available at:\\n[github.com/bguiz/front-end-js-testing](https://github.com/bguiz/front-end-js-testing \\\"Front-end Javascript Testing starter/ reference project\\\")\\n\\n### Asynchronous Assertions using Chai\\n\\nThe first thing to note is that in the Javascript world,\\nnearly everything is asynchronous.\\nThere quite likely are a mix of\\ncallback functions,\\npromises,\\ngenerator functions, and\\n`async` functions\\nin most Javascript applications.\\n\\nFor a primer on asynchronous Javascript, check out:\\n[Async Ascendance in Javascript](/2016/01/04/async-ascendance-in-javascript)\\n\\nThis means that our tests need to take that into account.\\n\\nFor this, in the starter project,\\nwe will extend our assertions library, `chai`,\\nwith `chai-as-promised`,\\nso that we can use `expect(somePromise).to.eventually.equal(someValue)`.\\n\\n### NodeJs Test Runner within a Browser-based Test Runner\\n\\nJust because we are using browser-based test runners,\\ndoes not mean that we need to learn a complete new structure\\nfor writing our test cases.\\n\\nTest runner libraries such as Mocha and Jasmine\\ncan be included within both Karma and WebdriverIO\\nas a framework,\\nand therefore you can continue writing test cases\\nusing syntax that is already familiar.\\n\\nFor this, in the starter project,\\nwe will be including Mocha as a framework\\nwithin both Karma and WebdriverIO.\\n\\n### Front-end Framework Agnostic\\n\\nIt is worth pointing out at this juncture\\nthat the set up for this project is\\nintentionally agnostic to the Javascript framework\\nthat the application may have been written with.\\n\\nBackboneJs, AngularJs, EmberJs, ReactJs, et cetera,\\nand all of their accompanying library and tool stacks\\nquite often come bundled with their own testing utilities.\\nWhere this is not the case,\\nthe community of developers usually has a consensus\\naround their preferred testing utilities.\\n\\nThis project however chooses to work with\\ntesting utilities and tools that are not tied to any one particular framework.\\nIn theory, they would work just as well with vanilla Javascript applications,\\nas they would with Javascript application built using one of these front-end frameworks.\\n\\n### Set up for the System Under Test\\n\\nThe front-end Javascript application we will be testing\\nin this case in the system under test.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install --no-progress\\nnpm run global-install\\nnpm run build-dev\\n```\\n\\nIn the directory of the starter project,\\nrun the commands above.\\nThis sets up both the local and global dependencies,\\nand uses Webpack to bundle the Javascript sources,\\nand uses `http-server` to serve static files on `localhost`.\\n\\nThis step does not have anything to do with testing,\\njust to do with the system under test.\\nBy all means, use any other set of tools to get this done,\\nas there are a myriad of different way to do this.\\n\\n### Set up and run Karma Unit Testing\\n\\nLook in\\n[`package.json`](https://github.com/bguiz/front-end-js-testing/blob/develop/package.json),\\nin the `devDependencies` section, and you'll find these:\\n\\n```\\n\\\"karma\\\": \\\"^0.13.8\\\",\\n\\\"karma-chrome-launcher\\\": \\\"^0.2.0\\\",\\n\\\"karma-mocha\\\": \\\"^0.2.0\\\",\\n\\\"karma-sinon-chai\\\": \\\"^1.0.0\\\",\\n\\\"karma-webpack\\\": \\\"^1.7.0\\\",\\n```\\n\\nThese have already been installed as part of the previous step.\\n\\nNext look in\\n[`karma.conf.js`](https://github.com/bguiz/front-end-js-testing/blob/develop/karma.conf.js),\\nand you'll find this:\\n\\n```\\nfiles: [\\n  'test/unit/**/*.spec.js'\\n],\\n```\\n\\nThis tells Karma to run any `*.spec.js` files\\nfound in `test/unit` or its subdirectories.\\n\\nFinally let us look in this folder,\\nand we see `test/unit/sample-unit.spec.js`,\\nwhich contains a couple of unit tests for `src/function-to-test.js`.\\n\\nIn order to run these unit tests, we can enter the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run unit-test-background\\n```\\n\\nTake a look in the `scripts` section of\\n[`package.json`](https://github.com/bguiz/front-end-js-testing/blob/develop/package.json)\\nto see exactly what this does.\\n\\nA new browser window should open,\\nrun through the tests once,\\nand then idle.\\nSwitch back to the command prompt,\\nand you will see the test output.\\n\\nTry modifying the test file, `test/unit/sample-unit.spec.js`\\nby inserting a new test case,\\nor modifying one that is already there.\\nWhen you save the file,\\nthe tests should re-run,\\ngiving you potentially different results.\\n\\nIf we wish for the tests to just run through once, and exit right away,\\ninstead of idling, and waiting for some changes,\\nwe can run the following command instead:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run unit-test\\n```\\n\\n## Set up and run WebdriverIO Integration Testing\\n\\nTake a look in the `scripts` section of\\n[`package.json`](https://github.com/bguiz/front-end-js-testing/blob/develop/package.json),\\nand you'll find the following lines:\\n\\n```\\n\\\"global-install\\\": \\\"npm i --global selenium-standalone@5.0.0 http-server@0.9.0 && selenium-standalone install\\\",\\n\\\"start-selenium-server\\\": \\\"selenium-standalone start\\\",\\n```\\n\\nLook in\\n[`package.json`](https://github.com/bguiz/front-end-js-testing/blob/develop/package.json),\\nin the `devDependencies` section, and you'll find these:\\n\\n```\\n\\\"wdio-mocha-framework\\\": \\\"^0.2.11\\\",\\n\\\"webdriverio\\\": \\\"^3.4.0\\\",\\n```\\n\\nThese commands did various global and local installations.\\nWebdriverIO uses a well known 3rd-party browser testing protocol,\\nthe Selenium protocol,\\nin order to do its integration testing.\\nThis requires it to have a Selenium server installed and running\\nbefore running the tests.\\n\\nTo start the Selenium server now, we run:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run start-selenium-server\\n```\\n\\nLeave that process running, while we examine the project further.\\n\\nOpen up\\n[`wdio.conf.js`](https://github.com/bguiz/front-end-js-testing/blob/develop/wdio.conf.js),\\nand you will see:\\n\\n```\\nspecs: [\\n    './test/integration/**/*.spec.js'\\n],\\n```\\n\\nThis tells WebdriverIO to run any `*.spec.js` files\\nfound in `test/integration` or its subdirectories.\\n\\nFinally let us look in this folder,\\nand we see `test/integration/sample-integration.spec.js`,\\nwhich contains a couple of integration tests for the application as a whole.\\n\\nIn order to run these integration tests, we can enter the following

of the tests will be visible in the terminal as well.\\n\\nThe difference that you'll notice,\\nfrom when running the unit tests,\\nis that we actually see the system under test appearing in the

Javascript to write applications that work on\\ndevices running windows.\\n\\nI have been packaging them up using Cordova/ Phonegap.\\nThis works well for Android and iOS,\\nbut not so well for Windows;\\nbut thankfully Microsoft has released a\\n*HTML + JS* offering which it calls *WinJS*,\\nand is essentially a tool chain which does what Cordova/ Phonegap do,\\nfrom Visual Studio, building Windows 10 UWP apps.\\n(There are also Windows 8 UWPs, but I won't go into that here.)\\n\\n## Windows 10 Workshop\\n\\nAttended a full-day workshop by\\nAndrew Wigley from *Microsoft* and\\nNick from *Built to Roam*.\\n\\nThe workshop day consisted of multiple *hands-on labs*.\\nThe workshops are available from\\n[this Github Repository](https://github.com/Windows-Readiness/WinDevHOLs),\\nand they include the completed source code,\\nbut more importantly PDF files with step by step instructions\\non how to create the applications from scratch,\\nwith screen shots along the way.\\nThese were extremely helpful, and very high quality -\\nI have yet to attend any workshop where the materials prepared were this great!\\n\\n## WinJS\\n\\nAll of the labs were focused on developing using .NET (*XAML + C#*),\\nwith the exception of one,\\nwhich covers WinJS (*HTML + JS*),\\nwhich is precisely the technology that I have been using.\\nThis lab, was by far the most useful one I have attended,\\nas it gave me one great idea to take away.\\n\\nThere is a tool called manifest which Microsoft has published on\\n[npm](http://npmjs.com).\\nPoint it at your own website,\\nand it will analyse it,\\nand generate a Visual Studio solution from it.\\nThis is essentially is a shell or wrapper around the website.\\nYou can then use standard Javascript feature detection techniques, e.g.:\\n\\n```javascript\\nif (window.WinJS) {\\n  // access Windows APIs\\n}\\n```\\n\\nin your main website in order to access device-specific APIs\\nfrom within your wrapped app.\\n(all within the confines of a standard security sandbox model, of course)\\n\\nA lot of bang, for very little buck!\\nOf course, this is *too good to be true*,\\nbecause a mobile app that requires constant Internet connectivity is...\\nwell not a very good mobile app at all!\\n\\n## Offline First\\n\\nI sat on this for a while,\\nletting the thought percolate in the background;\\nand I recalled the concept of offline-first web applications:\\nHere's a [primer on offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/).\\n\\nThe basic idea is that\\nwhen the user loads a page for the first time,\\nthe page is stored in your browser's regular ol' cache.\\nThe browser uses offline storage capabilities -\\n[`localStorage`/ IndexedDb/ WebSql](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage) -\\nto store information,\\nand [Service Worker APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)\\nas a fall back for when actual HTTP endpoints are not reachable.\\n\\nThat is quite exciting because it means that instead of\\nmaintaining a separate code base for a packaged app,\\nwe need just the one.\\nAn added benefit would be a much snappier regular web site.\\n\\n... but there is a catch,\\nfor Windows 10 UWP that is,\\nbecause it runs the same technology under the hood as\\nthe Edge browser, and it turns out that\\n[Edge doesn't support Service Worker APIs](http://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers).\\n\\nHope it lands soon!\\n\\n## So Windows 10?\\n\\nThe Javascript tool chain has a way to go yet -\\nDespite starting out with Windows 10,\\nand Visual Studio 2015 *already installed*,\\nthere was a constant stream of miscellaneous updates\\nthat needed to be installed for the next thing to work.\\nEach of these updates weighed in at over a Gigabyte,\\nand between ten and thirty minutes of \\\"applying changes\\\" time\\n(in addition to the download time).\\nI would estimate I spent about half the time at the workshop\\njust installing stuff, rather than following along and writing code.\\n\\nIf you are used to working with the `npm` ecosystem,\\nsuch a *high barrier to entry* just seems absurd.\\n\\nOne of the presenters said that you have to get \\\"all your stars to align\\\"\\nbefore some particular feature (Cortana, I recall) works.\\nIMHO, that is true in general about Microsoft's Javascript tool chain.\\n\\nThat being said, it is still early days,\\nand I hope they improve the developer experience.\\nIt is worth giving it a go, and\\n[this guide](https://github.com/Windows-Readiness/WinDevHOLs/tree/master/04.%20Edge%20and%20Web%20Apps \\\"Edge and Web Apps\\\")\\nis a great place to start.\\n\"\n      },\n

something to happen,\\nand then burst into life in short spurts whenever things need to happen.\\nThe most common one is waiting for user input -\\nfor a user to type something into a form,\\nor to press a button -\\nbut there are many other things that aren't user-related that\\nprograms typically have to wait for:\\nReading or writing files to disk,\\nand waiting on network latency,\\nand many, many more.\\n\\nNow, if your program was extremely selfish,\\nit could simply hog all the resources on your computer while waiting on these things.\\nThe problem is that users don't like selfish programs,\\nbecause they \\\"hang\\\" the computer -\\nthat is, when the computer becomes unresponsive.\\n\\nAdding asynchronous execution capabilities to your program\\nmakes it a much less selfish consumer of the resources on a computer,\\nand thus the computers don't \\\"hang\\\", and users are happy.\\nThis is pretty much default practice,\\nand you'll be hard pressed\\n(although it is not impossible)\\nto find programs that do not incorporate some form of asynchronous code execution.\\n\\n## The \\\"standard\\\" way, and the Javascript way\\n\\nMost programs are able to execute their code asynchronously by employing threads.\\nThreads are a where a single process defines more than one execution path,\\nleaving the operating system to time slice to share resources between each of them.\\n\\nThis is not how Javascript environments do it,\\nbecause Javascript is single-threaded.\\nInstead Javascript achieves asynchronous code execution\\nusing its own run-time engine to store events\\n(asynchronous execution entry points)\\nand execute them in an event loop.\\nEssentially this is also time slicing,\\nexcept that since it doesn't operate at the operating system's kernel level,\\nas a developer you need to reason about it in a different manner\\nthan you would do when programming using threads.\\n\\n*Footnote:*\\nThere are various proposals for Javascript to support multiple threads,\\nsuch as WebWorkers,\\nbut these haven't come to fruition yet.\\n\\n## How to Asynchronous\\n\\nSay you call Sync Sam,\\nas well as Async Alice,\\nand ask give each of them a task to do.\\nUsually that works out in one of two ways:\\n\\n1) You can say, \\\"I'll stay on the line,\\\"\\nand wait while they do the task,\\ntwiddling your thumbs in the mean time.\\n\\n2) You can say, \\\"How about you call me back at this number, when you're done?\\\"\\nThen hang up, and wait for them to call you back,\\nand you can do whatever you feel like until she does.\\n\\nBoth options are valid in different scenarios.\\n\\nLet's say that the task was for Sync Sam to\\nretrieve someone's address and give it to you.\\nHe has it on a sticky note somewhere at her desk,\\nso she can get back to you almost right away.\\nIn this scenario, the first option,\\nwhere you stay on the line is the valid one.\\n\\nLet's say, instead, that the task for Async Alice was a bit more involved.\\nIt involves her picking up something from the store around the corner.\\nThat would take much longer than would make sense to sit waiting on the phone.\\nSo the latter option, where you ask Async Alice to call you back when she\\nhas completed the task would make much more sense.\\n\\nIn other words, when you expect the task to be completed immediately,\\nyou should simply wait for the task to be done.\\nWhen you expect the task to take a while to complete,\\nyou should do something else instead, and wait to be notified before resuming;\\nand this is precisely what a callback does.\\nCallbacks are the basic building block of asynchronous programming\\nin Javascript.\\nCurrently, there are four mechanisms:\\ncallbacks and three others, each of which build upon callbacks.\\n\\n1. callback functions,\\n2. promises,\\n3. generator functions, and\\n4. `async` functions.\\n\\nLet's take a look at each of them.\\n\\n### Callback Functions\\n\\nCallbacks are the most basic, and easy to grasp,\\nway to do things asynchronously.\\nYou are simply providing a function,\\nand telling the Javascript engine to call you back when it is done doing whatever,\\nby calling the function.\\nHence the name \\\"callback\\\".\\n\\nNow let's a look at callbacks in action:\\n\\n```javascript\\ncallerFunction();\\n\\nfunction callerFunction() {\\n  console.log('I am going to call three nested callback functions');\\n  asyncUsingCallbackFunction('foo', function errBackFunction(err, result) {\\n    if (!!err) {\\n      console.log('There was an error:', err);\\n    }\\n    else {\\n      secondAsyncUsingCallbackFunction(result, function errBackFunction(err, result) {\\n        if (!!err) {\\n          console.log('There was an error:', err);\\n        }\\n        else {\\n          thirdAsyncUsingCallbackFunction(result, function errBackFunction(err, result) {\\n            if (!!err) {\\n              console.log('There was an error:', err);\\n            }\\n            else {\\n              console.log('Here is the result:', result);\\n            }\\n          });\\n        }\\n      });\\n    }\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nfunction asyncUsingCallbackFunction(input, callback) {\\n  setTimeout(function() {\\n    callback(undefined, input+'bar');\\n  }, 300);\\n}\\n\\nfunction secondAsyncUsingCallbackFunction(input, callback) {\\n  setTimeout(function() {\\n    callback(undefined, input+'baz');\\n  }, 300);\\n}\\n\\nfunction thirdAsyncUsingCallbackFunction(input, callback) {\\n  setTimeout(function() {\\n    callback(undefined, input+'meh');\\n  }, 300);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nRun this using NodeJs.\\nYou should get the output: `Here is the result: foobarbazmeh`,\\nbut you will have to wait for just under a second before it pops up.\\nTry tracing the control flow as the program executes.\\n\\n- The `callerFunction` simply runs two lines of code and then returns\\n- This would normally mean that the program has finished execution and exit\\n- However, it does not, because in the second line,\\n  `asyncUsingCallbackFunction` is called,\\n  and its second parameter happens to be a callback function.\\n- This callback function gets added to the stack in the event loop\\n  (well, technically, the anonymous function passed into `setTimeout`\\n  within it is the one that get added)\\n- When that function is done executing,\\n  it gets popped off the stack and gets executed by the event loop.\\n- The same thing happens with `secondAsyncUsingCallbackFunction`,\\n  and `thirdAsyncUsingCallbackFunction` in turn, recursively.\\n\\nHere is a great animation that\\n[demonstrates Javascript's event loop](http://latentflip.com/loupe)\\nwhich I like very much.\\n\\nObserve how the callback functions are \\\"nested\\\" within each other.\\n\\n### Promises\\n\\nWhile it is possible to write virtually any sort of asynchronous code\\nin Javascript, using only callbacks,\\nit only really tends to work well for simple tasks where there are one or two\\nasynchronous tasks that need to be done.\\n\\nIn more complex tasks where there are many asynchronous tasks,\\nif you were to write your code suing just callbacks,\\nyou would wind up with an anti-pattern known as\\n\\\"callback hell\\\" or \\\"pyramid of doom\\\".\\n\\nPromises have emerged to solve this problem.\\nThe main benefit that you get from promises are:\\n\\n1. You can write your asynchronous code in a \\\"flat\\\" way.\\n2. Instead of multiple error handlers (one for each asynchronous function),\\n   you can have a single error handler which handles errors across them all.\\n\\nPromises first came out as Javascript libraries -\\n`Q`, `RSVP`, and `bluebird` are amongst the most popular -\\nand these exposed functions that would wrap callbacks in clever ways.\\nThis evolved into a specification, and\\nnow, with ES6, the latest edition of Javascript,\\npromises are built into the language itself.\\n\\nLet's take a look at promises in action:\\n\\n```javascript\\ncallerFunction();\\n\\nfunction callerFunction() {\\n  console.log('I am going to call three chained promise functions');\\n  asyncUsingPromise('foo')\\n    .then(secondAsyncUsingPromise)\\n    .then(thirdAsyncUsingPromise)\\n    .then(function(result) {\\n      console.log('Here is the result:', result);\\n    })\\n    .catch(function(err) {\\n      console.log('There was an error:', err);\\n    });\\n}\\n\\nfunction asyncUsingPromise(input) {\\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n    setTimeout(function() {\\n      resolve(input+'bar');\\n    }, 300);\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nfunction secondAsyncUsingPromise(input) {\\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n    setTimeout(function() {\\n      resolve(input+'baz');\\n    }, 300);\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nfunction thirdAsyncUsingPromise(input) {\\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n    setTimeout(function() {\\n      resolve(input+'meh');\\n    }, 300);\\n  });\\n}\\n```\\n\\nRun this file using NodeJs and you'll get the same result as before,\\nwhen using callbacks.\\nThe main difference lies in the syntax.\\nEach of the functions,\\n`asyncUsingPromise`, `secondAsyncUsingPromise`, and `thirdAsyncUsingPromise`,\\nare now slightly more complex than before:\\nwe have to wrap them with `new Promise()` syntax.\\nHowever, doing this allows us to write the asynchronous code in a \\\"flat\\\" way -\\navoiding deep nesting -\\nand also means that we only have to write the error handling code once.\\nThis makes it easier to reason about the code while writing it.\\n\\n### Generator Functions + `yield`\\n\\nGenerator functions, used together with `yield`,\\nare yet another way in which you can\\ndo asynchronous programming,\\nand they have also landed in ES6 Javascript.\\n\\nLet's take a look at generator functions in action:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar co = require('co');\\n\\ncallerFunction();\\n\\nfunction callerFunction() {\\n  co(function * () {\\n    console.log('I am going to yield three consecutive generator functions');\\n    try {\\n      var firstResult = yield asyncUsingGenerator('foo');\\n      var secondResult = yield secondAsyncUsingGenerator(firstResult);\\n      var thirdResult = yield thirdAsyncUsingGenerator(secondResult);\\n      console.log('Here is the result:', thirdResult);\\n    } catch (err) {\\n      console.log('There was an error:', err);\\n    }\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nfunction asyncUsingGenerator(input) {\\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n    setTimeout(function() {\\n      resolve(input+'bar');\\n    }, 300);\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nfunction secondAsyncUsingGenerator(input) {\\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n    setTimeout(function() {\\n      resolve(input+'baz');\\n    }, 300);\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nfunction thirdAsyncUsingGenerator(input) {\\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n    setTimeout(function() {\\n      resolve(input+'meh');\\n    }, 300);\\n  });\\n}\\n```\\n\\nRun `npm install co` to install the `co` library\\nbefore running the above file with NodeJs.\\nYou'll get the same result as before,\\nwhen using promises or callbacks.\\n\\nNote that each of the functions,\\n`asyncUsingPromise`, `secondAsyncUsingPromise`, and `thirdAsyncUsingPromise`,\\nhave not changed at all from the promise-based code.\\nThese functions still return promises.\\n\\nWhat has changed,\\nis the way in which they are called, from `callerFunction`.\\nFirstly, the contents of `callerFunction` has now been\\nwrapped in an anonymous function, which has been, in turn,\\nwrapped in a `co` function, like so:\\n\\n```javascript\\nco(function * () { /* do stuff */ });\\n```\\n\\nYou'll also notice, that the anonymous function has an asterisk\\nbetween the function keyword and the parentheses for its parameters.\\nThis is what marks a function as a generator function.\\nGenerator functions are allowed to use the `yield` keyword\\nwithin their body.\\n\\nNow that we have got the syntax/ semantics out of the way...\\nlet's look at the main benefit,\\nand that is that you can write asynchronous code\\nusing syntax that is identical to the way you would write synchronous code.\\n\\n- With callback functions, the \\\"return value\\\" of the asynchronous function\\n  would come as the parameter of the callback function\\n- With promises, the \\\"return value\\\" of the asynchronous function\\n  would come as the parameter in the next function in the promise chain\\n- With generator functions, you the \\\"return value\\\" would\\n  **actually be** a return value,\\n  and you can assign it to a variable in line using `var` (or `let`) ...\\n  just like you would when writing synchronous code.\\n\\nA parallel exists for error handling as well.\\n\\n- With callback functions, errors are handled within the callback function\\n  by testing a parameter of the callback function\\n- With promises, errors are handled by the `catch` function in the promise chain\\n- With generator functions, errors are handled using a `try ... catch` block ...\\n  just like you would when writing synchronous code.\\n\\nBeing able to write asynchronous code with syntax that is\\nso close to synchronous code is *brilliant*.\\nPromises are an improvement over callback functions\\nbecause they remove the mental overhead of looking at deeply nested syntax.\\nGenerator functions are an improvement on promises -\\nin fact they *make use of* promises -\\nbecause they remove the mental overhead of thinking in terms of promise chains.\\n\\n*Footnote:*\\nGenerator functions and `yield`, on their own,\\nare not language constructs\\ndesigned to provide asynchronous code execution.\\nIt is more general purpose than that.\\nFor example, you can use them to output infinite sequences of numbers,\\nwhich is useful for mathematical applications and pure functional programming,\\nbut has nothing to do with asynchronous programming techniques.\\nThis is what the `co` library is used for -\\nto take generator functions,\\nand adapt them for the specific purposes of asynchronous code execution.\\nThink of `co` as a \\\"runner\\\" for generator functions.\\n\\n### `async` Functions + `await`\\n\\n`async` functions, used together with `await`,\\nare an even newer way in which you can do asynchronous programming.\\nSo new, in fact, that they have yet to become \\\"officially\\\" part of Javascript.\\nThey are slated for ES7,\\nthe next edition of Javascript.\\nYou can, however, use them today\\nvia your transpiler/ polyfiller of choice, e.g. `babel`.\\n\\nLet's take a look at `async` functions in action:\\n\\n```javascript\\ncallerFunction();\\n\\nasync function callerFunction() {\\n  console.log('I am going to await three async functions');\\n  try {\\n    var firstResult = await asyncUsingPromise('foo');\\n    var secondResult = await secondAsyncUsingThunkify(firstResult);\\n    var thirdResult = await thirdAsyncUsingPromisify(secondResult);\\n    console.log('Here is the result:', thirdResult);\\n  } catch (err) {\\n    console.log('There was an error:', err);\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nfunction asyncUsingGenerator(input) {\\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n    setTimeout(function() {\\n      resolve(input+'bar');\\n    }, 300);\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nfunction secondAsyncUsingGenerator(input) {\\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n    setTimeout(function() {\\n      resolve(input+'baz');\\n    }, 300);\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nfunction thirdAsyncUsingGenerator(input) {\\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n    setTimeout(function() {\\n      resolve(input+'meh');\\n    }, 300);\\n  });\\n}\\n```\\n\\nRun `npm install babel` to install the `babel` transpiler\\nbefore running the above file with `babel`'s interpreter:\\n`./node_modules/.bin/babel-node`.\\nYou need to do this because ES7 Javascript is not out yet -\\nwe're currently on ES6 -\\nand so we'll need a transpiler to get it running.\\nYou'll get the same result as before,\\nwhen using generator, promises, or callbacks.\\n\\nNote that each of the functions,\\n`asyncUsingPromise`, `secondAsyncUsingPromise`, and `thirdAsyncUsingPromise`,\\nhave not changed at all from either the promise-based code\\nor the generator-based code.\\n\\nWhat has changed from the generator-based `callerFunction` is that\\ninstead of using `co` as the \\\"runner\\\" that wraps a generator function,\\nthe entire `callerFunction` itself is now marked with the `async` keyword.\\nThis allows `callerFunction` to use the `await` keyword -\\nin a manner *very similar* to the way that generator functions use `yield`.\\nEssentially, there is no need for a \\\"runner\\\" function any longer -\\ninstead, these are supported natively.\\n\\n## Review\\n\\nLet's recap the different method of asynchronous programming\\navailable in Javascript.\\n\\n1. Callback functions\\n  - The most primitive method\\n  - \\\"Pyramid of doom\\\"\\n  - Available since 1st ever Javascript\\n2. Promises\\n  - Flattens the \\\"pyramid of doom\\\"\\n  - Consolidates error handling\\n  - Available as libraries in ES5, and natively in ES6\\n3. Generator functions + `yield`\\n  - Can write using synchronous code syntax\\n  - Need to use `co` (or other similar) library as a \\\"runner\\\"\\n  - Available natively in ES6\\n4. `async` functions + `await`\\n  - Can write using synchronous code syntax\\n  - Available in the future in ES7, and via transpilers in ES5 & ES6\\n\\nEach of these methods have their own pros and cons,\\nand it is up to you to pick which is appropriate.\\nMy own approach at the moment is to\\nuse callback functions, as they hard to beat for basics.\\nFor more complex things, on the other hand,\\nI currently use generator functions with promises.\\nWhen using together with older packages,\\nuse the `es6-promisify` NodeJs package\\nto \\\"promisify\\\" their callback functions.\\nIf you're willing to live on the bleeding edge,\\ngo for `async` functions;\\nhowever keep in mind the risk that its syntax could\\nchange considerably before it officially becomes part of ES7.\\n\\nIt is nice to see the evolution of Javascript in general as well,\\ngoing from primitive constructs to more advanced and expressive ones with time.\\nWriting asynchronous Javascript code is much much easier to do now\\nthan it used to be, and as this trend continues, the future's bright!\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/2015/12/17/letsencrypt-tls-certs-nodejs\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"title\": \"Let's Encrypt TLS certificates for NodeJs servers\",\n          \"date\": 1450297320000,\n          \"comments\": true,\n          \"tags\": [\n            \"nodejs\",\n            \"tls\"\n          ],\n          \"source\": \"src/documents/docpadposts/2015-12-17-letsencrypt-tls-certs-nodejs.html.md\",\n          \"url\": \"/2015/12/17/letsencrypt-tls-certs-nodejs\",\n          \"urlAliases\": []\n        },\n        \"body\": \"\\nLet's Encrypt is the new certificate authority in town,\\nenabling developers to generate their own TLS certificates -\\nwhich are necessary for running servers over HTTPS -\\nand it just went into public beta a week or so ago.\\n\\nBy default it is all set up and ready to go for Apache servers.\\nHowever, for other varieties of servers -\\nNodeJs included -\\na little more leg work is involved.\\nThat's what this post looks at.\\nParts of it are specific to NodeJs,\\nwith the remainder are applicable to any other platform.\\n\\nWe'll cover the following steps:\\n\\n1.

certificate\\nin order to be allowed to renew it.\\nIf your server is NodeJs (or anything other than Apache),\\nyou have 3 options:\\n\\n- `manual` - not scriptable, you have to do it by hand each time\\n- `standalone` - scriptable, but requires your server to be down for a certain amount of time\\n- `webroot` - scriptable, and you can keep your server running\\n\\nWe're going to pick the latter option, `webroot`,\\nbecause it is both scriptable,\\nand allows for zero server downtime during cert generation.\\nThe `webroot` option requires a `webroot-path` directory to be specified.\\nIf it doesn't exist, it will be created -\\nbut this is not a good idea,\\nbecause the file permissions will be of the root user,\\ncreating problems later on.\\nWe'll pre-empt this by creating the folder ourselves.\\nWe also create an empty file in there\\nso that a version control system like `git` keeps the folder when cloning it.\\n\\n```bash\\nmkdir -p certs/webroot/.well-known/acme-challenge/\\ntouch certs/webroot/.well-known/acme-challenge/.gitkeep\\n```\\n\\n## Respond to the authorisation challenge\\n\\nThe `letsencrypt` command line client will use your current certificates\\nand generate a temporary authorisation token,\\nand place it in the `webroot-path` that we just created above.\\nThe Let's Encrypt Certificate Authority server will then\\nmake a HTTP request to your server at this path:\\n`/.well-known/acme-challenge/$SOME_CHALLENGE_HASH`\\n\\n(substituting `$SOME_CHALLENGE_HASH` with an actual hash of course.)\\n\\nThus we need to add a new route to serve up static files from this folder\\nwhen such a path is requested.\\nThis is a fairly common thing for web servers to do,\\nso, again, feel free to use your own implementation.\\nFor the sake of completeness however,\\nhere's one implementation using `koa`.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// acme-router.js\\n'use strict';\\n\\nlet fs = require('fs');\\nlet path = require('path');\\n\\nlet koaRouter = require('koa-router');\\n\\nlet router = koaRouter({});\\n\\n// point to the middleware we wish to serve\\nrouter\\n  .get(\\n    'getWellKnownAcmeChallenge',\\n    '/.well-known/acme-challenge/:challengeHash',\\n    getWellKnownAcmeChallengeRoute);\\n\\nfunction *getWellKnownAcmeChallengeRoute() {\\n  try {\\n    let key = this.params.challengeHash;\\n    let val = yield getAcmeChallengeData(key);\\n    this.response.type = 'text/plain';\\n    this.response.body = `${val}`;\\n    this.response.status = 200;\\n  }\\n  catch (ex) {\\n    console.error(`Error: ${ex}`);\\n    console.error(ex.stack);\\n    this.response.body = {\\n      error: 'Failed to obtain challenge hash',\\n    };\\n    this.response.status = 500;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nfunction getAcmeChallengeData(key) {\\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\\n    let challengeFilePath = path.resolve(process.cwd(), `certs/webroot/.well-known/acme-challenge/${key}`);\\n    fs.readFile(challengeFilePath, 'utf8', (err, data) => {\\n      if (!!err || !data) {\\n        return reject(`No challenge for key ${key}`);\\n      }\\n      val = data.toString();\\n      return resolve(val);\\n    });\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nmodule.exports = router;\\n```\\n\\n## Update TLS certs shell script\\n\\nWe are now set up for renewing certificates,\\nand next we shall automate that,\\nso that you can fire-and-forget -\\nand focus on something other than busywork!\\n\\nWe start by creating a shell script\\nthat takes in two parameters,\\nfirst the domain,\\nand second the email address that should\\nbe associated with the certificates for this domain.\\n\\nFirst, it calls `letsencrypt-auto` to generate a new certificate,\\nor renew an existing one,\\nusing the `webroot` authorisation method that we have prepared previously.\\n\\nSecond, it takes the generated keys and copies them into the `certs` folder,\\n\\nThird, and finally, it executes the `refreshcerts` run script\\nin your NodeJs module for your server.\\n\\n```bash\\n#!/bin/bash\\n# update-tls-cerificates.sh\\n# bguiz @ 20151215\\n#

\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"refreshcerts\\\": \\\"# do something here that tells server to use the new certificates\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## `cron` job to automate cert renewal\\n\\nThe final piece of the puzzle is to set up a `cron` job\\nto invoke the shell script that renews your certificates,\\nand tells your server to refresh them.\\nLet's Encrypt's certificates expire every 90 days,\\nand therefore you should renew them at least as often as that.\\nThey recommend doing so once per month.\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo crontab -e\\n```\\n\\nIn the text editor, add the following line:\\n\\n```\\n0 0 15 * * /home/user/code/project/update-tls-certificates.sh \\\"example.com\\\" \\\"admin@example.com\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis will run our update script on the 15th of every month -\\nchange it to match what you want.\\n\\n## Fin\\n\\nThat's all there is to to it!\\n\\nIf you want to take this further,\\nyou can consider adding additional things to this routine,\\nsuch as emailing yourself whenever a certificate is renewed\\n(successfully or unsuccessfully).\\n\\nMany thanks Jonne Haß from the Let's Encrypt community forums\\nfor patiently helping me to troubleshoot

\"\\n## Asking about coding skill\\n\\n\\\"What are the levels of skill of a coder?\\\"\\n\\nThe answers that I get, usually, were something along the lines of:\\n\\\"fresh grad, mid-level developer, and senior developer\\\", or\\n\\\"software developer, software engineer, and software architect\\\".\\nMy guess is that this is based upon what the companies they work for\\nhave structured their development teams around.\\n\\n![Organisation chart, crossed out, 'does not apply to coders'](org-chart-crossed-out.png)\\n\\nThis is an easy means of classification, of course -\\nto simply use the classification already thrust upon you by your management.\\n\\nHere I'll posit an *alternative* means of thinking about coding skill,\\nthat is not based so much around *levels* of skill in writing code,\\nrather based around *traits* and behaviours when writing code.\\nIt is going to be highly subjective,\\nbut then again, you probably already got that from the title!\\n\\n## What is code?\\n\\nTo think about coders, you must of course think about their main craft:\\nthe code or the software that they write!\\n\\n... so - what is software, or what is code, really?\\n\\nAt a fundamental level all software is\\n**data**, and **decisions about that data**.\\n\\n![spreadsheets, electronics circuit symbols, more spreadsheets coming out at the other end](spreadsheets-circuits-spreadsheets.png)\\n\\n## Back to coders\\n\\nThat is the day-to-day challenge faced by all coders.\\nFor any coder,\\nno matter what software they write,\\nno matter what the project is they are working on,\\nno matter what company they work for -\\nit always boils down to\\ndata, and decisions made about that data.\\nThis fundamental nature, of course, is a double edged sword:\\nit is a simple philosophy,\\nbut simultaneously extremely open-ended.\\n\\nThe number of possibilities are endless -\\nlet's consider the following:\\n\\n![Binary tree extending forever, with a fading gradient applied at the bottom to imply it is infinite](binary-tree-to-infinity.png)\\n\\nHow do you structure your data,\\nwhere do you store it,\\nand in what format?\\nWhat does the data actually mean?\\nWhat operations do you perform on the data,\\nin what order,\\nand how do you optimise them?\\nHow does this data related to this other data,\\nor influence it?\\nThe **sheer number** of ways you can answer\\neach question - for any given task -\\ncreates a great many deal of decisions that need to be made.\\nIn many cases it can seem infinite.\\n\\n![Guy with crazy eyes](guy-with-crazy-eyes.png)\\n\\n... and it's mind boggling.\\n\\n## Coping mechanisms\\n\\nThe coders who have to make these decisions, of course,\\ndo not have infinite time - or patience - to deal with all of them.\\nCoders are human, after all!\\n\\n... so coping mechanisms are employed.\\n\\nCoping mechanisms are means with which people deal\\nwith things that are *beyond* their capability/ control.\\nIt's a way to reign in those things,\\nand still be an *effective person*.\\nIn that sense, they are great;\\nbut of course, the drawback is that they are inexact,\\nand at times are *short cuts*,\\ninstead of taking the proper route.\\n\\n(But who's to say what the proper routes are anyway?\\nJust take a gander at programmers forums, and you find plenty of debate\\non anything from the fundamental - like functional versus object-oriented -\\nto the highly specific - like automatic semicolon insertion in Javascript.\\nWe won't be going anywhere near those here, I promise!)\\n\\n## Digression on art & science\\n\\nThis is a big part of why, IMHO,\\nit is not possible to classify the act of writing code\\ninto either an art or a science.\\nIts logical and mathematical nature,\\nplus its roots in electrical engineering\\nmake it a **scientific** endeavour.\\nHowever, the expressiveness of the languages,\\nwith its own flavour of spelling and grammar rules,\\nand its open-endedness, with a myriad of ways to express the same thing,\\ncertainly make it an **artistic** endeavour as well.\\n\\n![Venn diagram, with science icon (chemical beaker) on the left, art icon (painting) on the right, and code in the intersection](venn-science-art-code.png)\\n\\n... but enough pre-amble!\\n\\n## Copy-pasta\\n\\nAt the early stages, the most common trait in writing code\\nis simply to copy what someone else has written.\\nI call this the copy-pasta.\\n\\n![Spaghetti bolognese](spaghetti.png)\\n\\nDoing something for the first time, and stuck figuring out how to do it?\\nWhy not just Google the relevant key words,\\nand chances are, you'll find that someone has already asked\\na very similar question on Stackoverflow,\\nand since the question was so similar,\\nthe answer most likely is as well!\\n\\n![Stackoverflow --> Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V / Cmd+C, Cmd+V --> sublime text](stackoverflow-cut-paste-editor.png)\\n\\nA couple of well-worn key-stroke combinations later,\\nyou have copied the relevant snippet into your your own code,\\nand run it to test if that has indeed solved the problem.\\n\\nHere's the thing:\\nafter a while you get very good at this skill of\\nknowing exactly what to search for,\\nand copying and pasting the relevant parts into your code.\\nSprinkle in a few modifications here and there\\nto adapt the snippet to the rest of your code,\\na few trial-and-error runs,\\nand you usually get the job done, and solve the problem.\\nYou can get very far as a coder,\\nsimply by mastering this skill.\\n\\n> \\\"I don't believe that copy-pasta coders should be used anywhere,\\n> maybe if they are copy-eat-cook-pasta coders:\\n> You may read, but you may not paste until you\\n> understand what you've read! :-)\\\"\\n>\\n> - Taco Kemna\\n\\nJust doing this alone isn't enough though.\\nYou might be able to maintain an existing code base,\\nfixing bugs and adding minor features here and there.\\nThat is totally fine, because that is precisely what\\nmost line-of-business software needs.\\n\\n## Code works in peaks and troughs\\n\\nBy default, software is in an almost *perpetually broken state*.\\nIf you are the end user of any software -\\nthis includes apps, websites, et cetera -\\nand think you have it bad when software is buggy,\\nspare a thought for the coders who wrote it:\\nWhat you experience is way, way, better than\\nwhat the coders deal with when coding it!\\n\\nAfter furiously coding for several hours at a stretch,\\nthere is a brief moment where the software *actually works* as it should,\\nand in that brief moment, we capture that precise state,\\ntag it, build it, and release it,\\nand ship it or deploy it to customers.\\nThis doesn't last for very long - the code is broken again,\\nbecause you started coding the next thing.\\n\\n![graph showing peaks and troughs, with arrows pointing to working and not working](graph-peaks-troughs-code-not-working.png)\\n\\nThe code sitting in your text editor,\\nthe code that you, as a coder stare at on the screen,\\nis in this perpetual cycle of peaks and troughs.\\n1% peaks, and 99% troughs.\\nThe truth is that as a coder,\\nyou spend less time actually writing code,\\nas you do stepping through code in a debugger, inspecting the data,\\nand inspecting the output logs.\\nAll of this to figure out where something went wrong.\\n\\n![guy banging his head against the keyboard](guy-banginghead-against-keyboard.gif)\\n\\nWe have all been there!\\n\\nSo actually *getting things to work* at all was an amazing feeling.\\nWhen something has been broken for several hours,\\nor sometimes even several days,\\nand you have been plugging away at it furiously,\\ntrying all manner of things to get the code to do\\nwhat you want it to do,\\nand you finally crack the problem,\\nand type that final line of code that fixes the problem,\\nhold your breath while you verify that it works,\\nand unlike all the previous times...\\nlo and behold, it works!\\n\\n*That* feeling is amazing.\\n\\n![A very happy looking puppy](happy-puppy.png)\\n\\nI liken it to the feeling that you get after\\nputting down the heavy objects that you have been lifting at the gym.\\nYou feel lighter - almost weightless even -\\nbecause it is suddenly less effort to stand up than immediately before;\\nand at the same time you get this post-exercise high\\nwith this all-round feel good feeling in your muscles and in your head.\\nBoth of those wear off after a couple of minutes of course,\\nand then you go in for your next set of lifting heavy objects.\\n\\n![guy doing deadlifts](doing-deadlifts.png)\\n\\nCopy-pasting code is what gets you\\nto that feeling of gratification quicker and more frequently.\\nAfter a while though, that elation that you get,\\nwhen you actually get things to work is no big deal any more.\\nAfter all, software is supposed to *just work* right?\\nWhat's the big deal that you got it to work for\\njust that tiny *sliver of time*, for just that fleeting moment?\\n\\n## Libraries, frameworks, and design patterns\\n\\nAt that point, you have the realisation that:\\nYou need to do something more than this.\\nYou need to get more consistently good results for the effort that you put in.\\nYou think about your craft more \\\"meta\\\" way -\\nwhat is the over-arching theme to the software,\\nhow can I make this code better,\\nand how can I make myself a better coder?\\n\\nThis realisation culminates in a shift in approach.\\nA shift away from ad-hoc solutions to ad-hoc problems;\\nand a shift toward meta solutions/ generalised solutions to repeatable problems.\\nInstead of copying or following individual snippets of code,\\nyou start copying or following patterns.\\n\\n![Frankenstein, caption \\\"what your code becomes after too much copy-pasta\\\"](frankenstein-copy-pasta-code.png)\\n\\nPatterns in code manifest themselves in a number of different ways,\\nmost commonly in the forms of:\\nsoftware design patterns, software libraries, software frameworks.\\n\\nRemember that code is data and decisions about that data.\\n\\n![spreadsheets, electronics circuit symbols, more spreadsheets coming out at the other end](spreadsheets-circuits-spreadsheets.png)\\n\\nWell by following patterns -\\nbe they by incorporating design patterns,\\nor utilising a library or framework -\\nyou as the coder have made a conscientious choice to\\nhave many of those *decisions made for you*.\\nLet's take a look at a couple of examples:\\n\\n> **Design pattern**: Singleton.\\n>\\n> By using a Singleton, you do not need to pass around an object instance\\n> everywhere that needs it; you simply need to refer to it by type.\\n\\n> **Library/ framework**: UnderscoreJs.\\n>\\n> By using UnderscoreJs, you do not need to implement your own means with which\\n> to do various common functional programming tasks;\\n> you simply need to invoke the functions defined in this library.\\n\\n![Library book shelf](library-book-shelf.png)\\n\\nThese things just got elevated to best idea since sliced bread,\\nbecause they solve your code problems not just on an ad-hoc basis,\\nbut in a repeatable way,\\nand often solve them in ways that pre-empt problems,\\nand thus result in many less problems encountered to begin with.\\n\\nSomeone else has already solved these various common problems\\nin a general manner, and for the most part in a robust manner to boot!\\nAll you have to do is to *re-use the solutions* to those common problems\\nby adapting them to the specifics of your software,\\nleaving you to focus on the rest.\\nYou are guided on how to structure your data,\\nand guided on the decisions that you have to make on the data.\\nThis reduces your workload,\\nleaving you to focus on a narrower part of your software,\\nmaking you more effective as a developer.\\n\\n![Recycling logo](recycling-logo.png)\\n\\n## Restraint\\n\\nThere are so many design patterns out there,\\nand there are so many libraries and frameworks too.\\nA new one seems to crop up so often that you barely have enough time\\nto learn and use one of them properly before its replacement comes along.\\nIt is super easy to get sucked into this cycle of permanently trying out\\nthe next new thing, of course,\\nbecause of a couple of fundamental psychological reasons:\\n\\n- The grass is always greener on the other side, and\\n- Curiosity\\n\\n![animal looking over the fence, which has grass on both sides](animal-looking-over-fence-grass-is-grenner.png)\\n\\nHowever, throwing more patterns and libraries at your code base\\n*is not necessarily* always a good idea.\\nThe more design patterns used in your code,\\nthe more *difficult* it becomes to interpret your code.\\nThe more libraries used in your code,\\nthe larger the API surface area that you have to be across\\nin order to understand how to work with your code.\\nThe over-arching theme here is that your code has gotten too \\\"meta\\\",\\neverything has been *over-generalised* or *over-abstracted*\\nin order to fit into particular patterns' or libraries' requirements.\\nSometimes a combination of them are outright contradictory,\\nbut most of the time they simply increase the mental overhead,\\nby being hard to grok when put together,\\nand feel \\\"forced\\\" when used together.\\n\\nCue for the next realisation to hit home.\\n\\n> அளவுக்கு மிஞ்சினால் அமிழ்தமும் நஞ்சு\\n> (In excess, even nectar is poison)\\n\\n![pot of honey (many), arrow, poison](too-much-honey-arrow-poison.png)\\n\\nWhile using more good patterns and libraries in your code means\\nthat you get all the good stuff that comes with them;\\nwhen used in excess they start to harm the project,\\nas you will soon come to realise.\\n\\nYou soon start asking yourself the following questions,\\nwhenever considering whether to use a new library,\\nor add a new design pattern:\\n\\n- How much does this increase the code's complexity?\\n- How long will it take for a fresh pair of eye to get up to speed on this?\\n- If the person that wrote *X* is not around,\\n  will we still be able to figure out how to progress?\\n\\nYou'll subsequently become more restrained when writing code:\\nBy **scaling back** on doing new things only because they work -\\nnow they must work, but also yield some additional benefit.\\nBy scaling back on doing things because they are new and shiny\\nand the compulsion to try them out.\\nBy understanding that when code written in the past has an influence on\\nthe way that code is written now, and therefore have\\na ripple effect on the way future code is written as well.\\n\\n![Git history of branches in gitg, captions for each of the commit messages](git-history-branches.png)\\n\\nCode itself may be transient, but its effect is semi-permanent.\\nMany a time you have come across a project that you need to work on,\\nbut get that feeling of dread -\\na feeling that you'd prefer to avoid touching this code if possible.\\nWell, that feeling is usually because your restraint antennae\\nhave kicked in, and they've sensed that there's a history to this code.\\nIts all gnarly, ugly, and unpleasant to work with,\\nand sort of grown into what it is right now because\\nof excessive use of libraries and patterns in the past.\\n\\n![Gnarly old tree grown around some obstacle in its way](tree-grown-around-obstacle.png)\\n\\nYou become more restrained, by becoming more selective.\\nMore picky, and less likely to OK the use of a new pattern or library.\\nYou would have been burned already, several times over in the past,\\nwith the after effects of letting too many of these things\\n**creep into** the code.\\nYou'd have had to deal with the after-effects of code whose\\ncomplexity has gone out of whack,\\ncode that even a *competent person* looking at for the first time\\nwould not be able to pick up and dive into right away,\\ncode that would be hard to modify in any way\\nin the absence of its original author.\\nScratch that - code that befuddles its original author too,\\nafter some time has passed!\\n\\n![Filter funnel with all the libs and pattern names at the top, and just a few of them getting through out at the bottom](filter-funnel-libs-patterns.png)\\n\\nThe restraint derives from the **irony** that\\nall of these patterns and libraries were added with the initial intent\\nto make the data simpler\\nand to reduce the complexity of the decisions about that data.\\nHowever, **through overuse**, the data actually started getting more complex,\\nand the decisions to be made about the data\\nactually have become harder to understand.\\n\\n![graph plotting complexity level against number of patterns+libs, like a quadratic curve](graph-complexity-vs-patterns-libs.png)\\n\\n## Classifying coders\\n\\nThese traits and behaviours of coders\\nheavily influence the type of software that they write.\\nYou've got the **copy-pasta coder** who\\nsolves problems *ad-hoc* by copy-pasting snippets of code from the Internet;\\nthen you've got the **easily-excitable coder** who\\nattempts to use as *many* design patterns + libraries + frameworks as possible;\\nand finally you have got the **restrained coder** who\\nis picky and *says no* to adding most new things.\\n\\n![Three steps, each with a stick man sitting on top of it at a desk, each labelled 'copy-pasta', 'easily-excitable', and 'restrained'](three-steps-coders.png)\\n\\nThere's a natural progression as well:\\nA total newbie quite often starts off as a **copy-pasta**,\\nand then becomes an **easily-excitable** one,\\nand finally becomes **restrained** one;\\nin chronological order.\\n\\n## How about teams?\\n\\nMost coders have a dominant trait amongst these three ones,\\nthe dominant one usually being the one acquired most recently.\\n\\n- One cannot be using copy-paste too much:\\n  General solutions in terms of abstractions and code re-use are necessary\\n- One cannot be too easily excitable about new design patterns, libraries, and frameworks:\\n  Too much of that makes the code too complex to reason about\\n- One cannot be too restrained:\\n  It staves off creativity and innovation\\n\\nProfessional software development is rarely ever done as a solo pursuit -\\nusually we are organised into teams\\n(or scrums, or whatever label teams are given)\\nA good team needs people with *all* of the above traits,\\nthey need to keep each other at bay in order to *balance* them.\\n\\nThis balance is sufficient to create a team that works well\\nin writing good code.\\nBetter yet, we could all strive to be balanced within ourselves,\\nand wear the different hats at different times as appropriate.\\nAfter all, if each coder within a team was themselves already balanced,\\nthen the team would be balanced by default -\\nand no-one needs to feel awkward for telling\\nwhat the other person should change about the way that they code.\\n\\n![Door hinge + WD-40 = Smiley Face](door-hinge-wd40.png)\\n\\nIf the team is comprised of coders with\\nvery very strong bents toward any of these traits,\\nthe teamwork is going to be akin to rusty door hinges:\\nthe door still can opens and shut,\\nbut it is going to make a lot of noise and irritate anyone nearby.\\nIf each coder in that team can balance the traits within themselves,\\nthat's like a spraying some WD-40 on the hinge.\\n\\n## It's a wrap\\n\\n![Old school silent black and white film with \\\"Fin!\\\"](old-school-film-fin.png)\\n\\ntl;dr=\\n\\nThe act of writing code is both an art and a science,\\nand at a fundamental level it boils down to\\ndata and making decisions about that data.\\nThis can be infinitely complex,\\nbecause of the sheer number of ways to do each thing,\\nand the permutations and combinations thereof.\\n\\nCoders are human beings, and human beings cannot handle infinite complexity.\\nThus they seek ways to be still effective and productive at writing code\\nby managing this infinite complexity.\\nThis manifests itself in the form of three common

Authentication in using LiveSDK\\n  - Install via NuGet\\n  - Application manifest for extra Internets\\n  - WL.* APIs + caveats\\n3. Backend for uploading a file to OneDrive\\n  - Using the `access_token`\\n  - OneDrive APIs\\n\\n## Set up Windows-Phonegap app in Visual Studio\\n\\n### Phonegap tools to generate the solution\\n\\nThe first thing that we need is to generate a Visual Studio solution.\\n\\n- Install Phonegap via npm\\n  - ```bash\\n    npm install --global phonegap\\n    ```\\n- Generate a Visual Studio solution for a new project\\n  - ```bash\\n    phonegap create livesdk-onedrive-demo\\n    cd livesdk-onedrive-demo\\n    phonegap platform add windows\\n    phonegap build windows\\n    ```\\n\\nNow that we have generated the project,\\nwe can build and debug the project in an IDE.\\n\\n- Open Microsoft Visual Studio 2015\\n- Hit `Ctrl+Shift+O` to open a solution\\n- Open to `livesdk-onedrive-demo/platforms/windows/CordovaApp.sln`\\n- Note that every time you run `phonegap build windows`\\n  - The contents of `livesdk-onedrive-demo/platforms/windows/*` get overwritten, so be careful\\n  - This means that when developing the app in Visual Studio,\\n    we must edit the contents of the generated folder,\\n    and then copy back out to the root folder (`livesdk-onedrive-demo/`)\\n    before committing to `git` (or other VCS),\\n    and before running the `phonegap build windows` command again.\\n  - This is a major source of frustration, as it does not affect\\n    other platforms such as Android.\\n\\n### Create a Microsoft account\\n\\nIn order to test that any of this works,\\nyou will need a Microsoft account.\\n\\nA Microsoft account is a OneDrive account.\\nNote that, confusingly enough,\\nneither Hotmail accounts nor an Office365 email accounts are considered Microsoft accounts.\\nThat is the equivalent of Google deeming GMail and Google Plus accounts to not be Google accounts.\\nI have it on good word from developers at Microsoft that they are looking into changing this.\\n\\n- Skip this step if you already have a Microsoft account\\n- [What is a Microsoft account?](http://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/account/default.aspx)\\n- [Sign up](https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx)\\n- Use any email address that you already own\\n\\n### Create a Windows Store developer account\\n\\nIn order to publish your app to the Windows app store,\\nyou will need a developer account for it.\\n\\n- Skip this step if you already have a Windows Store developer account\\n- [Sign up](https://appdev.microsoft.com/StorePortals/en-sg/Account/signup/start)\\n- Use the email address of the Microsoft account that you created earlier\\n- You have to pay for this:\\n  - Approximately $20 for individuals\\n  - Approximately $100 for businesses\\n\\n### Registering the app with the Windows app store\\n\\nIn order to do anything with your app which\\nrequires that the user logs in to their Microsoft account,\\nyou need to register the app with the Windows app store.\\nIn order to do this, you need a developer account.\\nThe developer account is not free,\\nwhich means that you cannot develop or test this feature without paying first.\\n\\n- Menu: `Project --> Store --> Associate App with the Store`\\n- Dialog: Associate\\n- Dialog: Sign in to Microsoft Account - Password\\n- Dialog: Sign in to Microsoft Account - Two factor authentication\\n- Dialog: Waiting for developer account to load\\n- Dialog: Selecting an application name\\n- Dialog: Associate confirm\\n- Solution Explorer:\\n  - Check that the following file has been created\\n  - `Solution 'Cordova App' --> CordovaApp --> CordovaApp.Windows --> CordovaApp.Windows_StoreKey.pfx`\\n\\n## LiveSDK for authentication\\n\\nIn order for your app to **know**\\nwho a particular user is,\\nand for the user to give permissions to the app to access their account -\\nin order to do stuff such as uploading to their OneDrive -\\nthey need to log in to their Microsoft account.\\nThe LiveSDK plugin is how we do this.\\n\\n### Install LiveSDK via NuGet\\n\\nNuGet is a package manager for .NET projects.\\nWe use it to install LiveSDK.\\n\\n- Menu: `Project --> Manage NuGet packages...`\\n- Tab: \\\"NuGet Package Manager\\\"\\n  - Search for `LiveSDK`\\n  - Select latest stable version (`v5.6.2` at time of writing)\\n  - Install it\\n\\n### Application manifest for extra Internets\\n\\nWe also need to modify the project configuration to allow it access to the Internet.\\nBy default, it allows limited access,\\nbut we can extend this to include all forms of Internet access.\\n\\n- Solution Explorer:\\n  - Open this file\\n  - `Solution 'Cordova App' --> CordovaApp --> CordovaApp.Windows --> package.windows.appxmanifest`\\n- Tab: `package.windows.appxmanifest`\\n  - Select \\\"Internet (Client & Server)\\\"\\n  - Select \\\"Private Networks (Client & Server)\\\"\\n\\n### Windows Live APIs\\n\\nLiveSDK exposes several Windows Live APIs via the `window.WL` object\\nin a Cordova project.\\n\\n- Add script tag for `/js/wl.js` immediately after `cordova.js`\\n  - ```html\\n      <!-- Platform native wrappers -->\\n      <script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"cordova.js\\\"></script>\\n      <script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"/js/wl.js\\\"></script>\\n    ```\\n- Scopes\\n  - Be very careful about which scopes you can use\\n  - Each scope will allow the app to access certain features\\n  - For uploading a file to one drive the combination that we found we needed was:\\n    - ```javascript\\n      WL\\n            .login({\\n              scope: ['wl.signin', 'wl.basic', 'wl.offline_access',\\n                'wl.skydrive_update', 'wl.contacts_skydrive',\\n                'onedrive.readwrite']\\n            })\\n      ```\\n\\nUnfortunately, LiveSDK suffers from some problems which\\nmake developing for it difficult.\\nThese are the ones that caused me the most difficulties.\\n\\n- Fractured documentation\\n  - The **only** [correct reference for scopes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh243646.aspx)\\n  - Every API will also mention the scopes that it needs, and these are often partially correct - which means that they do not work at all\\n  - In particular, pay attention to [\\\"Subset and superset behavior\\\"](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh243646.aspx#subset_superset)\\n    - This caused me much pain, because when `WL.login()` was called with a `scope`\\n      containing both `wl.skydrive` and  `wl.skydrive_update`, write operations always failed authorization,\\n      however, when there was only `wl.skydrive_update` (which is a \\\"suyperset\\\" of `wl.skydrive`) went through just fine\\n  - Still not completely clear about what the difference is between `wl.skydrive_update` and `onedrive.readwrite`,\\n    or why both were needed for this case.\\n- Cannot log out\\n  - Error got was:\\n    - ```\\n      \\\"[WL]Logging out the user is not supported in current session because the user is logged in with a Microsoft account on this computer.\\n      To logout, the user may quit the app or log out from the computer.\\\"\\n      ```\\n  - However, quitting the app has no effect, and I have not yet logged out of my account -\\n    and have no intention of doing so.\\n    I feel that I should be able to log out of an app at any time I feel like,\\n    and no app should require me to log out of my operating system in order to log out within the app\\n    - This has been raised with developers from Microsoft,\\n      and they have indicated that they *may* look into this in the future.\\n      For now, however, they suggested looking into `WL.basic()` as an alternative to `WL.login()`\\n\\n## Upload file to OneDrive\\n\\nSo far, we have only managed to install the necessary libraries,\\nand authenticate the user.\\nNow we can finally get around to the original intent,\\nwhich is uploading a file to a user's OneDrive.\\n\\n### Using the `access_token` on the front end\\n\\nWe need an access token, obtained during authentication,\\nin order to interact with a user's account,\\nincluding their OneDrive.\\n\\n- `WL.login()` returns a promise\\n  - ```javascript\\n    WL\\n      .login(/* ... */)\\n      .then(function onLoginSuccess(result) {\\n        // Do something with result\\n      }, function onLoginFailure(err) {\\n        // Do something with err\\n      });\\n    ```\\n- In the success callback of the promise, the first parameter is the result object,\\n  which should look something like this:\\n  - ```javascript\\n    {\\n      status: 'connected',\\n      session: {\\n        access_token: 'AReallyLongBase64EncodedToken',\\n      },\\n    }\\n    ```\\nNow if we were to invoke the Windows Live APIs,\\nwhich includes the OneDrive APIs,\\ndirectly from the front end,\\nwe have no use for these.\\nWe can simply call `WL.api()` and have that deal with the necessary authentication related work\\nHowever, in this case, we want to call our own back end APIs,\\nand have the back end upload a file to OneDrive on our behalf.\\nThis is where `session.access_token` comes into play\\n\\n### Using the `access_token` on the back end\\n\\nWith the access token passed from the front end\\nand in the hands of the back end,\\nwe can next invoke the relevant OneDrive APIs to upload the file.\\n\\n- Our own back end API thus receives the `access_token`,\\n  along with other information about the file that it needs to upload,\\n  such as the file name\\n- The first step is to determine the folder ID that we should upload to, using a HTTP GET request\\n  - In C#:\\n    - ```csharp\\n      public virtual string GetUploadLocation(string accessToken) {\\n        // Find out the folder ID (and therefore also the upload path) of the root directory in OneDrive\\n          var request =\\n            (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(\\n              String.format(\\\"https://apis.live.net/v5.0/me/skydrive?access_token={0}\\\", accessToken));\\n          request.Method = \\\"GET\\\";\\n          var response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();\\n          var responseReader = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream());\\n\\n          // Parse the JSON response and extract the upload_location property\\n          string jsonStr = responseReader.ReadToEnd();\\n          var json =\\n            (Dictionary<string, dynamic>)JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(\\n              jsonStr, typeof(Dictionary<string, dynamic>));\\n          return json[\\\"upload_location\\\"].ToString();\\n      }\\n      ```\\n- The second step is to actually perform the upload, using a HTTP PUT request\\n  - In C#:\\n    - ```csharp\\n      public virtual HttpWebResponse UploadFile(string accessToken, string fileName, byte[] fileData) {\\n          // Construct the upload URL\\n          String folderName = GetUploadLocation(accessToken);\\n          var uploadFileUrl = new Uri(\\n            String.Format(\\\"{0}{1}?access_token={2}\\\", folderName, fileName, accessToken));\\n\\n          // Upload the file by means of a streaming writer\\n          var request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(uploadFileUrl);\\n          request.Method = \\\"PUT\\\";\\n          request.ContentLength = fileData.Length;\\n          request.AllowWriteStreamBuffering = true;\\n          Stream stream = request.GetRequestStream();\\n          stream.Write(fileData, 0, fileData.Length);\\n          stream.Close();\\n\\n          return (HttpWebResponse) request.GetResponse();\\n      }\\n      ```\\n\\nThis part is the most straightforward part,\\nhowever, also the part that fails,\\nand thus feels like is at fault.\\nIn implementing this, the biggest source of grief was that using\\nthe wrong scope in `WL.login()` was the biggest cause of errors\\nThe responses returned by the Windows Live APIs were\\nsimply HTTP error codes (401, 403 and 405) plus their generic descriptions.\\nIt would be much more helpful if the responses\\nwere to include a reason as well,\\nsuch as \\\"You need the wl.skydrive_update scope to perform this action\\\"\\n\\nMicrosoft also has published some docs on the brand new \\\"Unified APIS\\\",\\navailable on the subdomain, `graph.microsoft.com`,\\nhowever, these unified APIs do not cover OneDrive.\\nIt would be great if it did though.\\n\\n## Thanks\\n\\nThanks to Saurabh Pawar for the work on the back end to upload the file to OneDrive.\\n\\nThanks to Rocky Heckman, Kiril Seksenov, & Ali Al Abbas from Microsoft\\nfor their help with navigating Windows APIs.\\n\"\n      },\n

because as a software engineer,\\nyour job is not not to write code for code's sake,\\nbut rather to write code to solve some business problem,\\nor create some value for the business.\\nThat translates to most work being focussed on accomplishing\\nrather ordinary tasks,\\nby finding the right libraries that perform the necessary tasks,\\nand simply connecting them together,\\nsuch that the assembled aggregate accomplishes the goal.\\n\\nI liken this to what a plumber does.\\nIn order for the kitchen sink, laundry, and toilets to all work properly,\\nthere are quite a number of interesting bits and bobs that need to be in place.\\nValves, faucets, pipes of various diameters and shapes, et cetera.\\nBut these are all pre-made -\\nwhen something goes wrong somewhere,\\nthe plumber merely identifies where the problem has occurred,\\nfind the appropriate part,\\nand replace it accordingly.\\nThe the main tools of the trade are\\nidentifying which parts go with which other parts,\\nand connecting them together properly.\\nThat's not all too different from what the typical software engineer does day to day.\\n\\n## Yearning for the alternative\\n\\nSome software engineers are pretty happy plumbing code together -\\nthat is great for them!\\n\\nWhat if you are one who is not though,\\nwhat if you are one who yearns for that greater stimulation -\\none who who is not fulfilled with connecting a valve to a pipe,\\nbut wants to make the valve themselves?\\n\\nHere is my list of things to do to satisfy that urge:\\n\\n- Actively be on the lookout for something that needs solving\\n- If something has already been solved, take a look at its internal workings,\\n  and put some thought into whether this can be solved in a different way\\n- Where you cannot find something original, seek to make the plumbing easier\\n  - Make the plumbing experience easier/ more accessible in the future\\n  - If you do not want to make a new valve, find a better way to connect the valve to a pipe\\n  - This could mean doing things like improving the API, writing a DSL,\\n    or contributing to the documentation, for an existing project\\n\"\n      },\n

   \"body\": \"\\nI made my first contribution to the Rust compiler yesterday evening!\\n\\n![Rust logo](/images/posts/rust-logo.svg)\\n\\nThe learning curve was quite steep,\\nso I started with something relatively simple -\\nadding a detailed error message for one of the errors thrown by the compiler.\\n\\nIf only for my own future reference,\\nI detail the entire process below:\\nCompiling --> Verification --> Submission --> Acceptance --> CI\\n\\n## Compiling\\n\\nCompiling `rustc` for the first time:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.git\\ncd rust/\\n./configure\\nmake -j 4\\nsudo make install\\n```\\n\\nNow edit some source code to add the new feature or fix the bug.\\n\\n### Re-compiling\\n\\nAfter making some changes:\\n\\n```bash\\nmake -j 4 rustc-stage1\\nexport PATH=$( pwd )/${PLATFORM}/stage1/bin:$PATH\\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$( pwd )/${PLATFORM}/stage1/lib\\nwhich rustc\\nrustc --version\\n```\\n\\n(The value of `${PLATFORM}` should be obtained from the build output, e.g.\\n`x86_64-linux-gnu` or `x86_64-apple-darwin`)\\n\\nInstead of compiling the entire project all over again,\\nwhich will take extremely long,\\nsimply compiling one of the compile targets (`rustc-stage1`),\\nand adding the relevant output files to the executable and library paths\\nis a much quicker alternative.\\n\\n## Verifying the fix\\n\\nIn my case, the change was to add the detailed explanation message for\\na particular error message.\\nTo test this, run the `--explain` command:\\n\\n```bash\\nrustc --explain E0265\\n```\\n\\nWhich should output the following;\\n\\n<pre>\\n  This error indicates that a constant references itself.\\n  All constants need to resolve to a value in an acyclic manner.\\n\\n  For example, neither of the following can be sensibly compiled:\\n\\n  ```\\n  const X: u32 = X;\\n  ```\\n\\n  ```\\n  const X: u32 = Y;\\n  const Y: u32 = X;\\n  ```\\n</pre>\\n\\n## Submitting the patch\\n\\nOnce the patch is OK,\\nfork the repository on github,\\ncommit and push to your fork on a new branch,\\nand then submit a pull request for your patch.\\n\\n[Fork the repository on github](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust#fork-destination-box)\\n\\nSwitch the remotes such that the `upstream` points to the `rust-lang` organisation's repository,\\nand the `origin` points to the your forked copy of the repository.\\n\\n```bash\\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:rust-lang/rust.git\\ngit remote remove origin\\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:${GH_USER}/rust.git\\n```\\n\\nCommit and push:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit checkout -b ${SOME_BRANCH_NAME}\\ngit add src/\\ngit commit\\n# Enter a commit message\\ngit push origin ${SOME_BRANCH_NAME}\\n```\\n\\n[Visit the main repository on github again](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust),\\nand click on the link for \\\"compare and create pull request\\\".\\n\\nThis results in a pull request:\\n[github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/24894](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/24894)\\n\\n## Patch acceptance and Continuous Integration\\n\\nSomeone from the core team or reviewers team for Rust\\nwill get assigned to review the pull request,\\nand if it passes their review, they will add a comment like this:\\n\\n> @bors: r+ `${COMMIT_HASH}`\\n\\nThis triggers the Bors Github bot,\\nand the patch is added to the Homu build queue.\\nVisit the build queue, and find your patch on the list:\\n\\n[buildbot.rust-lang.org/homu/queue/rust](http://buildbot.rust-lang.org/homu/queue/rust)\\n\\nNote that you will find that the project contains a\\n[`.travis.yml` file](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/.travis.yml).\\nThis led me to believe, initially,\\nthat Rust uses Travis as its continuous integration system.\\nHowever, it only uses Travis for `make tidy`,\\nwhich is essentially a linting task.\\nI assume that this is because compiling rust takes a lot longer than\\nthe maximum of forty minutes per build allowed by Travis.\\nThe actual CI infrastructure for Rust consists of a couple of Github bots\\n- [rust-highfive](https://github.com/rust-highfive)\\nand [bors](https://github.com/bors) -\\nand their own CI server - [Homu](https://github.com/barosl/homu).\\n\\n## Experience\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, it was an extremely steep learning curve.\\n\\nIt takes **extremely long** to compile the project from scratch.\\nEven just the `rustc-stage1` target, takes ages.\\nThis is quite a big inhibitor for further contributions,\\nas one would have to have access to an extremely powerful build machine\\nin order to attain a reasonable amount of productivity developing Rust itself.\\nIf possible, I would like this to change.\\nPerhaps break the project up into several smaller ones,\\nand make it possible just to recompile the ones that changed.\\n\\nThis problem spills over to the build queue as well.\\nIt took just under two days for my patch to get compiled and tested\\nby the continuous integration system,\\nand get merged in.\\n\\nLuckily I had a couple of experienced guys to guide me -\\nthanks to [Michael](https://github.com/michaelsproul)\\nand [Huon](https://github.com/huonw)\\nfor walking me through the innards of `librustc` and `libsyntax`!\\n\\n## Now your turn!\\n\\nIf you are interested to get your contributions on,\\n[this issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24407)\\nis a good place to start.\\n\\nAt first I attempted to fix\\n[this one](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24889),\\nhowever, it was beyond my current Rust skills,\\nso I have had to let that be.\\nDouble points to anyone who tackles that!\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/articles/kids-learn-code/activity-design\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n

Slow down & simplify\\n2. Maria Montesori's teaching methods\\n3. Gamification\\n\\n### Slow down and simplify\\n\\nAs detailed in the [thesis](../thesis/),\\ncomputer science and thus programming is taught at a university level,\\nwith a mostly well defined syllabus.\\nIts syllabus, is, designed appropriately for the target age group,\\nwhom typically commence studying these topics between the ages of 18 and 21.\\n\\nPrior to that age group, however,\\nthere are roughly twelve years in which children receive formal education at schools,\\nin which they are typically not exposed to any of the concepts\\nthat are required foundational to learning computer science or programming at university.\\nThis results in a \\\"pre-selection\\\" of sorts,\\nthat only a small subset of children,\\nwho have been lucky enough to pick up these concepts\\noutside of what they were taught formally at school.\\n\\nThere have been other attempts to fill that twelve year void.\\nSimplified programming is one attempt,\\nfor example by making various lines of code or control flow structures\\navailable as drag-and-droppable jigsaw puzzle pieces,\\nsuch as Scratch and Alice.\\nAnother attempt is to explain through one-trick-ponies,\\nfor example by picking a concept such as making a turtle\\nmove around a board and do things through instructions,\\nsuch as logo and several physical board games that are inspired by it.\\n\\nThe shortcoming of simplified programming environments,\\nsuch as Scratch and Alice,\\nis that while they simplify, they fail to slow down.\\nThey do not explain the fundamental concepts behind the drag-and-drop jigsaw pieces,\\nthey have to be inferred, and the children who do not get it, continue to not get it.\\n\\nThe shortcoming of the one-trick-ponies,\\nis that while they do both slow down and simplify,\\nthey only do so for a narrow section of programming concepts.\\nThey use analogies and metaphors that children are able to grasp,\\nbut they do not employ a comprehensive set of them -\\nnot enough to constitute an entire syllabus.\\n\\nThus, how do we slow down and simplify,\\nin order to teach children programming?\\nWe have to find ways to teach the fundamental concepts of programming\\nbased on things they already do know, or can already relate to;\\nand we have to design a comprehensive set of activities\\nwhich can be conducted, supervised, and assessed\\nby a teacher in a classroom environment.\\nActivities are not lessons,\\nthey are a hybrid, or an in-between,\\nof play time and a lessons.\\n\\nHow do we design such activities?\\n[Maria Montessori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Montessori)\\npioneered many techniques that have been adapted to teach children\\nthe subjects that they learn in school today.\\nIf we are to treat programming as a subject taught in schools\\non par with mathematics, science, languages, et cetera,\\nthen we would do well to adapt the same methods for this subject too!\\n\\n### Maria Montessori's teaching methods\\n\\nMontessori identified the following types of actions that\\nchildren tend to perform:\\n\\n* Abstraction\\n* Activity\\n* Communication\\n* Exactness\\n* Exploration\\n* Manipulation of the environment\\n* Order\\n* Orientation\\n* Repetition\\n* Self-Perfection\\n* Work (purposeful activity)\\n\\nAfter identifying these, she designed her classroom around activities\\nthat would utilise these natural behaviours and actions\\nby incorporating them into her teaching methods,\\nin the belief that by doing so,\\nlearning would happen more spontaneously and naturally.\\nThis culminated in essentially setting up each classroom lesson as a\\nprepared environment that is designed to facilitate such spontaneous learning,\\nand simultaneously to steer the learning toward the intended concepts.\\n\\nIn designing the activities, the action types listed above will be highlighted.\\nRather than creating a syllabus in the more traditional way -\\ncreating a table with columns for content, instruction material, and tests to verify understanding,\\nthe syllabus will be designed around activities,\\nand how each of these activities facilitate spontaneous learning according\\nto these action types will be first and foremost.\\nSecondarily, each of activity will be linked back to the traditional syllabus constructs.\\n\\n### Gamification\\n\\nLearning is not an activity where the teacher imparts a chunk of knowledge\\nto the students.\\nIt can be just that, but that would make it ineffective,\\nmore-so when the students are younger.\\nInstead, learning could be an activity where the student is continually\\ngiven feedback on how well they are learning,\\nthrough recognition and rewards (not just by graded tests).\\n\\n[Gamification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) -\\nthe use of game mechanics in non-game contexts -\\nis a natural fit in this situation.\\nGamification employs various techniques,\\nsuch as giving students stickers, badges, or even real objects such as toys,\\nas a reward mechanism designed to foster better class participation,\\nand increase their motivation to learn.\\nGreat teachers have known this for a long time,\\nway before the term \\\"gamification\\\" had first been coined -\\nmany of them used to give us star-stickers to paste in our notebooks,\\nand sometimes paste them on a board at the front wall of the class (a leader board).\\n\\nThis creates an excellent feedback loop between teacher and student,\\nhowever, it can be improved by having another party added to this feedback loop:\\nthe parents!\\nSites and apps such as [classdojo](http://classdojo.com/)\\nhave identified this, and made this very easy to do.\\nThis means that when a child is rewarded,\\nhe/ she is not just rewarded at school, but also at home,\\ncreating a much stronger reinforcement.\\n\\n## Activity Structure\\n\\nFor each activity, the following things should be identified,\\nand detailed where appropriate.\\n\\n- Activity Name\\n- Fundamental concepts, and building blocks linked to\\n  - One activity may link to **one or more** of these\\n  - At minimum each fundamental concept and building block should have\\n    an activity which teaches it in isolation\\n  - Syllabus should be structured such that activities which teach a combination\\n    should be taught **after** the ones that teach each of its constituent items in isolation\\n- Related activities\\n  - Identify which activities are pre-requisite to this one\\n  - Identify which activities are easier than this one\\n  - These two bits of information will be useful in determining the possible ways\\n    to order the activities for teaching.\\n- Activity overview\\n  - A brief blurb describing the activity\\n- Child's natural actions facilitated\\n  - List each of the types of actions, and indicate whether they are facilitated\\n  - For each one that is facilitated, describe **where and how** this is done\\n- Physical objects required\\n  - List each of the objects that is required: e.g. boxes, wooden blocks, coloured papers, etc.\\n    - This includes teachers' aids where necessary\\n  - For each object describe what they are used as an **analogy or metaphor** for:\\n    e.g. Boxes represent variables, and we use markers to write the variable names on them.\\n- Prepared environment\\n  - Apart from the physical objects, what other things in the classroom\\n    are going to be used to facilitate learning and need to be set up prior?\\n  - Safety precautions:\\n    e.g. Do not use marbles if children are under a certain age, use ____ instead\\n- Sequence of instruction and assessment\\n  - Draw a **flow chart** for the things that will be done in the activity\\n  - Use **different colours** (or other visual cue) for\\n    nodes that are related to instruction,\\n    and for nodes that are related to assessment\\n  - Detail what will be done in each node of the flow chart, if necessary,\\n    in prose below the flow chart\\n  - Try to **intersperse** the instructional steps and the assessment steps in the flow chart\\n    - **Avoid** having a \\\"test\\\" or \\\"quiz\\\" at the end - the core concept is facilitating spontaneous learning!\\n    - A steady alternation between instruction and assessment is much better\\n- Gamification\\n  - List each of the rewards (stickers, badges, or real objects)\\n    that the students will get for participating or doing well\\n  - Describe the means with which these rewards\\n    will be communicated to the child's parents; e.g. Using classdojo\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/articles/kids-learn-code/activities/variables/concept\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n

Variables\\n2. Boolean logic\\n3. Counting &lowast;\\n4. Input & Output\\n\\nBuilding blocks:\\n\\n1. Control flow\\n2. Iteration\\n3. Functions\\n4. Events\\n\\nI posit that most programming boils down to\\ntwo fundamental concepts:\\nvariables and Boolean logic;\\nand four building blocks:\\ncontrol flow, iteration, functions, and events.\\nAn additional fundamental concept that is required for programming,\\nbut can be assumed knowledge for the child, is being able to count.\\n\\nThe fundamental concepts are abstract concepts,\\nand thus going to be challenging to teach to young children.\\nThus the means to teaching these should be to use analogy and metaphor devices.\\nAnalogies and metaphors, of course, that a child would be able to relate to.\\nFor example, when teaching variables to university students,\\nwe can assume that since they have a solid mathematics background.\\nSince mathematics includes algebra,\\nvariables can be easily explained as algebra.\\nUsing the same thought process,\\nbut this time applied to children,\\nwe realise that children aged six through twelve,\\ntypically would not have learnt algebra yet.\\nOne thing that we can be sure that every six year old knows though,\\nis that they have learnt how to\\nto put things into boxes,\\nto put things inside boxes to find out that they do not fit,\\nto take things out of boxes,\\nto look inside boxes,\\nand to move boxes (both empty and when containing things) -\\nthese are all part of any child's play time!\\nSo putting things in boxes could be a way in which\\nthe concept of variables are introduced to children,\\nwhich should not be very difficult for them to grasp.\\n\\nThe building blocks are little more concrete,\\nbut the same strategy applies as with the fundamental concepts:\\nUse analogies and metaphors which children are able to relate to themselves.\\nWith university students,\\ncontrol flow, iteration, and functions can all be illustrated using flow charts.\\nHowever, this is likely to lose children;\\nor bore them.\\nGetting them to play a game where each one represents an instruction\\n(a single code statement)\\nand the teacher - or one of the children, guided by the teacher -\\nwalk to each of them,\\nand then \\\"execute\\\" the statement by going to the child\\nwhich represents the next instruction determined by\\nthe control flow, or iteration, or function.\\n\\nOnce these have been taught in isolation,\\nit is time to combine them.\\nFor example, variables plus control flow could be done with\\nthe teacher carrying a few cardboard boxes\\nwith variable name written on them using a marker.\\nStrings can be placed into these boxes as pieces of paper,\\nand integers as several of the same item (such as marbles),\\net cetera.\\nAfter this set up, the children take their spots,\\nwith flash cards that denote their instructions,\\nand the teachers walks from one child to the next,\\nexecuting each of their instructions in turn -\\nreading out or modifying the contents of the variable boxes for some instructions,\\nand moving to a different student for control flow instructions.\\n\\n### Next: Simplified Programming\\n\\nNow that the fundamental concepts have been taught in isolation,\\nactual programming can commence.\\nOf course before delving straight into programming with\\na text editor/ compiler/ SDKs,\\nfor kids, using a simplified programming environment,\\nsuch as Scratch or Alice will be much better.\\n\\nThe idea is that when \\\"coding\\\" for the first time,\\nin the simplified programming environments,\\nthe kids are not being introduced to programming concepts,\\nand having to execute them at the same time.\\nThe cognitive burden could prove to be too much\\nfor the younger ones.\\nWith this approach, they can recall the fundamental concepts\\nand building blocks that have been learnt prior;\\nwhile attempting to execute them and create a program.\\n\\nThis is a stepping stone to full blown programming,\\nand thus should not be skipped.\\nSure some children might not need this intermediate step,\\nbut many will.\\nThe idea here is to not be too easy, for fear of\\nboring most of the children in the class;\\nand not to be too hard either, for fear of\\nlosing most of the children in the class.\\nLet's do this\\n\\nIn addition, there are many, high quality,\\nand ready to use, lesson plans\\ndesigned for a classroom environments\\ncentred around these simplified programming environments.\\nThey even comes with comprehensive syllabi in some cases.\\nIt would be a waste not to utilise these resources.\\n\\n## Why Teach Kids Programming?\\n\\nSomething would be amiss with this article,\\nif the question of why teaching kids to code is important\\nwas not addressed.\\n\\n//TODO\\n\\n- The kids will ask you this themselves -\\n  they do so for all subjects that they learn!\\n- A lucrative profession to be in when they are adult\\n- A means to teach logical thinking skills that can be applied in other areas\\n- ... many more!\\n\\n## References\\n\\n1.

YUIdoc](../jshint-jasmine-istanbul-yuidoc.png)\\n\\n## Linting in NodeJs\\n\\n![JsHint](../jshint.png)\\n\\nRun the following commands in the terminal to\\ninstall dependencies for JsHint,\\nand to create the various configuration files required.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install --save-dev jshint jshint-stylish\\ntouch .gitignore .jshintrc .jshintignore .travis.yml\\n```\\n\\nIn **package.json**, add a `lint` command to the `scripts` section.\\n\\n```javascript\\n    \\\"lint\\\": \\\"./node_modules/jshint/bin/jshint --verbose --reporter ./node_modules/jshint-stylish .\\\"\\n```\\n\\nIn **.travis.yml**, we set it up to build a NodeJs application,\\nand then run `npm run lint`:\\n\\n```yaml\\nlanguage: node_js\\nnode_js:\\n  - \\\"0.10\\\"\\n  - \\\"0.11\\\"\\n  - \\\"0.12\\\"\\n  - \\\"iojs\\\"\\n  - \\\"iojs-v1.0.4\\\"\\nscript:\\n  - npm run lint\\n```\\n\\nThe lint task above runs JsHint,\\nwhich will look for a **.jshintrc** file, and a **.jshintignore** file,\\nif present.\\n\\nUse [this sample **.jshintrc** file](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/blob/master/examples/.jshintrc)\\nas a starting point,\\nand modify it to change that value of `\\\"node\\\"`,\\nunder the `Environments` section, to `true`.\\n\\nUse this **.jshintignore** file to prevent JsHint from linting your dependencies.\\n\\n```text\\n/node_modules\\n```\\n\\nIn **.gitignore**, do the same thing,\\nthis time, to ensure that `node_modules` do not get checked in.\\n\\n```text\\n/node_modules\\n```\\n\\nNote that the `node_modules` directory is ignored by default,\\nbut this is just the starting point,\\nand will be building up from here.\\n\\nNow run the lint command in the terminal:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run lint\\n```\\n\\nYou should see the expected output -\\neither no errors when there are none;\\nor errors output to the console when they are present.\\nAlso check that when there are no errors,\\nthe process exit code should be zero;\\nand when there are errors,\\nthe process exit code should be non-zero.\\nIn a bash terminal, you can do this using the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\necho $?\\n```\\n\\nAt this point, commit and push these changes to the Github remote,\\nand Travis should automatically queue a build for it.\\nThe intent is for the build to fail if there are any JsHint errors.\\n\\nVerify that this is the case by committing something with an innocuous Javascript\\nerror, such as an extraneous semicolon character (`;`),\\njust to see Travis fail the build,\\nand then commit again without the error,\\nto fix the build.\\n\\nThat is all that we need to do,\\nto make a project use continuous integration,\\nand have linting.\\n\\n## Testing in NodeJs\\n\\n![Jasmine](../jasmine.png)\\n\\nIn the terminal, run the following commands to install the test runner, `jasmine-node`,\\nand set up the directory for the tests:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install --save-dev jasmine-node\\ntouch .npmignore\\nmkdir test\\n```\\n\\nAdd the following `test` command to **package.json**,\\nto execute tests using the `jasmine-node` test runner.\\n\\n```javascript\\n    \\\"test\\\": \\\"node ./node_modules/jasmine-node/bin/jasmine-node test\\\"\\n```\\n\\nWe edit **.npmignore** to be the same as **.gitignore**,\\nexcept that we exclude the folder containing the tests.\\nOther projects depending on this project should not have to run its tests,\\nonly this project should need to run its own tests.\\n\\n```text\\n/node_modules\\n/.travis.yml\\n/test\\n```\\n\\nUnlike linting,\\nwhich works out of the box using only configuration files,\\ntesting needs a lot of additional work to be done:\\nWriting the tests.\\n\\nUnfortunately, writing tests is out of the scope of this article\\nRefer to the following documentation:\\n\\n- [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.2/introduction.html)\\n- [jasmine-node](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node)\\n\\nNow, once you have written some tests,\\nplace the test files into the `tests` directory,\\nand you should be able to run `npm run test`.\\n\\nYou should see the test results.\\nAs with linting,\\nintroduce a bug in your source code that is intended to fail the tests,\\nand run the tests again, to make sure a failure does indeed get captured.\\nAlso test that the process exits with the expected exit codes.\\n\\nAfter verifying these, it is time to add these tests to Travis.\\nSimply add `npm run test` to **.travis.yml**, like so:\\n\\n```yaml\\nlanguage: node_js\\nnode_js:\\n  - \\\"0.10\\\"\\n  - \\\"0.11\\\"\\n  - \\\"0.12\\\"\\n  - \\\"iojs\\\"\\n  - \\\"iojs-v1.0.4\\\"\\nscript:\\n  - npm run lint\\n  - npm run test\\n```\\n\\nAs before, commit and push your changes,\\nwith and without intentional test failures,\\nto check that Travis fails the continuous build,\\nand then passes it again.\\n\\nPat yourself on the back,\\nbecause adding tests is the hardest task in this process.\\nThe remainder are relatively easy to do.\\n\\n## Coverage in NodeJs\\n\\n![Istanbul](../istanbul.png \\\"Note: The Istanbul project does not have a logo at all, so here is my crappy attempt at creating one using a Turkish carpet\\\")\\n\\nIn the terminal, install `istanbul`,\\nwhich is the code coverage tool that we will be using:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install --save-dev istanbul\\n```\\n\\nNow, add a `cover` task to the `scripts` section in **package.json**:\\n\\n```javascript\\n    \\\"cover\\\": \\\"node ./node_modules/istanbul/lib/cli cover ./node_modules/jasmine-node/bin/jasmine-node test\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThe `cover` command is a little more complex than the `lint` command\\nand the `test` command.\\nHere, we are running the `istanbul` tool,\\nand passing it in the path of the script that runs `jasmine-node`\\nand all of its parameters.\\n`istanbul` is smart enough to augment `jasmine-node`'s test runner,\\nfor its code coverage purposes,\\nwithout `jasmine-node` even knowing what is happening to it.\\nThink of `istanbul` as the test runner runner.\\n\\n`istanbul`, like any other code coverage tool,\\nparses the Javascript code being tested by the test runner,\\nand \\\"instruments\\\" it with its own code that hooks into various counters used to\\nkeep track of sections of code that have been executed.\\nThis is why `istanbul` needs to run `jasmine-node`.\\n\\nTo test that it works, run `npm run cover`.\\nYou should see the same output as there was previously when running `npm run test`,\\nbut then followed by some output that shows you test coverage,\\nwhich should look similar to this.\\n\\n```text\\n=============================================================================\\nWriting coverage object [/code/plugin-registry/coverage/coverage.json]\\nWriting coverage reports at [/code/plugin-registry/coverage]\\n=============================================================================\\n\\n=============================== Coverage summary ===============================\\nStatements   : 100% ( 97/97 ), 2 ignored\\nBranches     : 100% ( 50/50 ), 2 ignored\\nFunctions    : 100% ( 13/13 )\\nLines        : 100% ( 97/97 )\\n================================================================================\\n```\\n\\nThe output merely shows you the headline statistics,\\nand the detailed output lies in the reports,\\nwhich can be found in the `coverage` folder.\\n\\nTo see the HTML report, run this command (any browser of your choice will do):\\n\\n```bash\\nfirefox coverage/lcov-report/index.html &\\n```\\n\\nThis is the human-readable report.\\n\\nThere is another report however,\\nwhich is output to `coverage/lcov.info`,\\nand this is the file which other code coverage tools,\\nsuch as Coveralls, will need to analyse.\\n\\nTo verify that the coverage runs correctly,\\nsimply add an empty function that does not do anything and check to see if the coverage percentage decreases from its previous count.\\nNext enter many of such useless functions,\\nto the point that `istanbul` fails the build.\\nThen get rid of all the excess functions,\\nand run the command again to verify that that `istanbul` passes the build once more,\\nand that the code coverage percentages go right back up.\\nWhile doing this, ensure that the process exit codes match accordingly.\\n\\nLet us install `coveralls` by entering the following command in the terminal:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install --save-dev coveralls\\ntouch .coveralls.yml\\n```\\n\\nAdd the Coveralls repository token,\\nwhich you can get from the Coveralls website, to **.coveralls.yml**:\\n\\n```text\\nrepo_token: COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN\\n```\\n\\nNext, we add a `coveralls` task to the `scripts` section in **package.json**:\\n\\n```javascript\\n    \\\"coveralls\\\": \\\"cat ./coverage/lcov.info | ./node_modules/coveralls/bin/coveralls.js\\\"\\n```\\n\\nCoveralls does not actually do its own builds,\\nso Travis has to do the build,\\nand selected coverage related artefacts from the build need to be sent to Coveralls.\\nThis is what the `coveralls` module is responsible for:\\nreading in a coverage report, in `lcov` format,\\nand communicating that report into Coveralls.\\nThe `coveralls` command which we just defined runs the `cover` command,\\nand then pipes the `lcov` file output by `istanbul` to `coveralls`.\\n\\nWe are now almost ready for Coveralls,\\nbut first we need to tell Travis to run the `cover` and `coveralls` commands,\\ninstead of `test` as it was doing previously.\\nIt is not necessary to do both `test` and `coveralls`,\\nbecause that will mean that `test` runs twice!\\n\\nEdit **.travis.yml** to add `npm run coveralls`:\\n\\n```yaml\\nlanguage: node_js\\nnode_js:\\n  - \\\"0.10\\\"\\n  - \\\"0.11\\\"\\n  - \\\"0.12\\\"\\n  - \\\"iojs\\\"\\n  - \\\"iojs-v1.0.4\\\"\\nscript:\\n  - npm run lint\\n  - npm run cover\\nafter_success:\\n  - npm run coveralls\\n```\\n\\nLastly, we have to do some house keeping,\\nensuring that the coverage related files are ignored.\\n\\nEdit **.gitignore** to ignore `coverage` output and `.coveralls.yml`.\\nThe Coveralls repository ID is supposed to be kept private.\\n\\n```text\\n/node_modules\\n/coverage\\n/.coveralls.yml\\n```\\n\\nEdit **.npmignore** to do the same.\\n\\n```text\\n/node_modules\\n/coverage\\n/.travis.yml\\n/.coveralls.yml\\n/test\\n```\\n\\nEdit **.jshintignore** to do the same too.\\n\\n```text\\n/node_modules\\n/coverage\\n/test\\n```\\n\\nNow, when you commit and push these changes,\\nyou should see Travis build the project.\\nIn the mean time, you should see Coveralls idle.\\nOnce the Travis build succeeds,\\nthe Coveralls build should trigger,\\nand you should see a code coverage report.\\n\\n## Documentation for NodeJs\\n\\nDocumentation is requires the most CI work,\\nbecause it is not just about running a script, in a fire-and-forget style.\\nIt involves an additional step of collecting the build artifacts -\\nthe generated documentation - and publishing them too.\\nWe have already done this previously,\\nafter generating the code coverage reports,\\nwe export them to coveralls.io.\\nThis was fairly easy to do because there was an npm package\\nthat simply took care of these steps.\\nDocumentation, however, is more work,\\nbecause we have to write the steps to do this manually.\\n\\n### Generating documentation\\n\\n![YUIdoc](../yuidoc.png)\\n\\nWe install YUIdoc and a theme for it:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install --save-dev yuidocjs yuidoc-lucid-theme\\ntouch yuidoc.json\\n```\\n\\nEdit **yuidoc.json** to configure it.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"options\\\": {\\n    \\\"exclude\\\": \\\"coverage,documentation,node_modules,test\\\",\\n    \\\"paths\\\": \\\"**/*.js\\\",\\n    \\\"tabtospace\\\": 2,\\n    \\\"outdir\\\": \\\"documentation\\\",\\n    \\\"themedir\\\" : \\\"node_modules/yuidoc-lucid-theme\\\",\\n    \\\"helpers\\\" : [ \\\"node_modules/yuidoc-lucid-theme/helpers/helpers.js\\\" ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe then add the `document` command to the `scripts` section in `package.json`\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"generatedocs\\\": \\\"node ./node_modules/yuidocjs/lib/cli .\\\",\\n```\\n\\nNow when we run `npm run generatedocs`,\\ndocumentation for the project will be generated,\\nand output to the `documentation` directory.\\n\\nNext, we need to ignore `documentation` folder,\\nso add `/documentation` to **.gitignore**, **.npmignore**, and **.jshintignore**.\\n\\n### Publishing documentation\\n\\nWe can run the `generatedocs` command locally,\\nand then access the documentation by opening it in the browser,\\nfor example, using `firefox documentation/index.html`.\\nHowever, this is not very useful from a **continuous integration perspective**,\\nas any build artefacts produced are **discarded** after the build has completed.\\nIn Travis, the only artefact that is preserved automatically\\nare the output logs from the build.\\nIt would be much better if Travis were to actually copy the documentation\\nproduced during the build to a a web server which\\nusers of this project could use as a reference.\\n\\nWe will be publishing our documentation on Github Pages,\\nwhich hosts static files belonging to Github projects for free.\\n\\nFirstly, set up Travis with permissions to write to your Github repository,\\nusing instructions from the [general page](../general/).\\nYou should have `GH_TOKEN` encrypted and stored in `env.global.secure` in `.travis.yml`.\\n\\nWe now add additional build steps to `.travis.yml`\\n\\n```yaml\\nafter_success:\\n- npm run autodocs\\n- npm run coveralls\\nenv:\\n  global:\\n  - secure: YOUR_ENCRYPTED_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN\\n```\\n\\nIn `env.global`, we define a list of environment variables that should be\\nset during builds.\\nThe first one should have already been set (`secure`),\\nand any other configuration settings for autodocs should be set here if required.\\n\\nBy default, `autodocs` will incpect the environment variables set by Travis,\\nand determine whether:\\n\\n- Not a pull request\\n- Currently on the `\\\"master\\\"` branch\\n- Current job number is the first within the current build\\n\\nIf all of these are true, it will do `npm run generatedocs`,\\nand then publish the generated documentation to Github pages.\\n\\nYou can configure it to use a different branch,\\nand even to build on releases (when a tag is pushed, instead of a branch).\\nRefer to [`autodocs` API documentation](http://autodocs.js.org/api/latest/)\\nfor the full set of options that may be configured.\\n\\nWe then add the `autodocs` command to the `scripts` section in `package.json`\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"autodocs\\\": \\\"bash ./publish-docs.sh\\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Badges for NodeJs\\n\\nAdd the following to **README.md**,\\npreferably immediately after the title:\\n\\n```markdown\\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/MODULE_NAME.png)](https://github.com/GITHUB_NAME/MODULE_NAME/)\\n\\n[![Build

contributing to open source projects for years\\n\\nWhichever your scenario is,\\nit is always a good idea to pause and reflect upon whether\\nyou are a good steward of the open source projects that you maintain,\\nor even just contribute to.\\n\\nI started my journey in the pre-Github days,\\nwhere most open source projects were versioned using Subversion,\\nand Sourceforge was the main hub of collaboration.\\nI have not-fond memories of how slow and unusable the website was,\\nand resorting to creating diff-patches,\\nand emailing them to the maintainers.\\n\\nSince then things have improved vastly,\\nin terms of the tools that were available.\\nGit supplanted Subversion as the de facto version control system,\\nand branching and merging became so much easier -\\nnot to mention faster - to do.\\n\\n![Github, Travis, Coveralls](../github-travis-coveralls.png)\\n\\nHot on the tails of git,\\ncame Github, which made collaborative source code version control\\nthat much more *accessible* and *user friendly*.\\nThat was not the only tool to spring up though,\\nand other sites, which build on top of the popularity and ease of use of Github,\\nsuch as Travis and Coveralls have come up too.\\n\\nMost of the open source software that I write now is in Javascript,\\nand the creation of NodeJs as a platform,\\nand the explosion in the richness of the packages available in npm,\\nits package manager,\\nhas created a vibrant open source ecosystem,\\nthat works great hand in hand with Github/ Travis/ Coveralls.\\n\\nThe concepts I cover below are applicable to most open source software.\\nThe examples, however, will be specific to Javascript/ NodeJs.\\n\\n## Continuous Integration\\n\\n### Github\\n\\n![Github](../github.png)\\n\\nGithub is a service which hosts your Git repositories,\\nfor free if they are open source,\\nand for money if they are closed source.\\nIt exposes a very easy to use web user interface (try it!)\\nfor interacting with Git repositories.\\nYou do not need to be a command line expert to do advanced Git things,\\nyou can get very far within your browser alone.\\n\\nGithub is not just a Git host though.\\nIt lends itself well to continuous integration,\\nas well as web hooks and APIs which allow it to integrate well other tools,\\nincluding Travis and Coveralls.\\n\\n### Travis\\n\\n![Travis](../travis.png)\\n\\nTravis is a continuous integration system,\\nwhich is free for all open source projects hosted on Github -\\nwith paid versions for closed source projects hosted anywhere, of course.\\n\\nIt integrates really easily into Github,\\nas it automatically detects whenever a branch or tag is pushed to a Github repository,\\nvia web hooks,\\nand automatically triggers a build from it,\\nnotifying you by email when a passing build fails,\\na failing build continues to fail, and a failing build passes.\\n\\nIt is reliable, and reasonably fast to boot.\\n\\n#### Setting up Travis\\n\\nCreate account and login - it could not be any easier,\\nyou simply have to click on the log in with Github button.\\n\\n##### Ruby (official)\\n\\n```bash\\n# Install Ruby Version Manager\\ngpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3\\ncurl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash\\nsource ${HOME}/.rvm/scripts/rvm\\n\\n# Install a version of Ruby\\nrvm install ruby-1.9.3-p448-dev\\nrvm use --default ruby-1.9.3-p448-dev\\n\\n# Install Travis gem\\ngem install travis\\n```\\n\\nNow get a token from Github to give Travis permissions to write to your repository.\\n\\n- [Generate new Github access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)\\n- Select **only** the second option, `public_repo`\\n- Enter a description, such as \\\"For Travis CI\\\", and hit \\\"Generate Token\\\"\\n- Copy the value shown on the next page, and enter the next command,\\n  replacing `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the value you just copied.\\n  (Be sure to have a leading space in front of your command,\\n  so that it does not leave a copy in your bash history)\\n\\n```bash\\n# Set up Travis with write access to your Github repository\\n  travis encrypt GH_TOKEN=GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN --add\\n\\n# Should see a new value for `env.global.secure` added as a base-64 encoded string\\ncat .travis.yml\\n```\\n\\n##### NodeJs (3rd party)\\n\\nAlternatively, if you prefer to use NodeJs instead of Ruby:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install --global travis-encrypt\\ntravis-encrypt -r GITHUB_REPO_SLUG GH_TOKEN=GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN\\n```\\n\\nCopy the output from `travis-encrypt` to `.travis.yml` under `env.global`.\\n\\nFrom now on, Travis script will have access to an environment variable,\\nnamed `GH_TOKEN`, and can be later used for writing to your Github repositories.\\n\\n### Coveralls\\n\\n![Coveralls](../coveralls.png)\\n\\nCoveralls is not a continuous integration system,\\nbut rather should be thought of as a \\\"view\\\"\\nfor **code coverage** related build artefacts,\\nproduced as a result of a continuous integration build.\\n\\nOf course, we will use Travis to do the actual continuous integration builds,\\nand simply pass the relevant outputs it generates to Coveralls.\\n\\nIts business model is similar to that of Travis -\\nfree for all open source projects hosted on Github,\\nand paid for closed source projects hosted elsewhere.\\n\\n## Linting\\n\\nOpen your wardrobe, and pull out a jacket\\nwhich you have not worn in a while.\\nWhen you wear it, you notice that it has these little bits of\\ngrey fluff on it here and there.\\nSo you pinch the ones that you see off of it, and throw them away.\\nGive it an hour, and you will be sure to notice more fluff,\\nthat you'll have to pick off.\\nDoes not really matter though,\\nyou're still wearing your jacket,\\nand it more or less performs that same function it would\\nwithout the lint on it.\\nIt would not make you look very good though.\\n\\n### Software Linting\\n\\nAn analogous thing happens when writing software.\\nSometimes the code that you write has errors in it\\nthat are innocuous enough that they do not cause the software to break.\\nHowever, when there are too many of these,\\nthings start to look ugly.\\nSometimes they simply deceive the eye of the developer,\\nand reveal themselves only when put under express scrutiny,\\nflying under the radar most of the time.\\nThey become a hindrance when collaboratively writing software\\nin a team, or with the broader open source community.\\n\\nThat is where linting tools come into play.\\nThey programmatically analyse your source to identify\\nwhere these innocuous errors,\\nor violation of coding style guidelines have occurred,\\nand point out where they are, so that they may be addressed.\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nTesting and coverage are closely related,\\nand the two go hand in hand.\\nIn fact the latter cannot happen without the former.\\n\\nImagine that you are a school teacher,\\nand you are creating a quiz or test for your students,\\nand it consists of multiple choice questions\\nand fill-in-the-blank questions.\\nPrior to the test, you tell your students to study a particular book,\\nand that the questions asked in the test\\nwill be derived from the information contained in that book.\\n\\nWhile the students are preparing by studiously,\\nyou are busy setting the questions too.\\nYou are interested in verifying whether they have covered all the material in the book,\\nso for each chapter in the book,\\nyou find several pieces of information or concepts\\nwhere knowing those would demonstrate an understanding of that chapter.\\nYou then write down a series of questions in one document,\\nand then the answer for each question in another document.\\n\\nOn the day of the test,\\nyou tell your students to put their books away,\\nas it is time for the test to begin.\\nThen you distribute copies of the first document -\\nwith the questions - to each of them,\\nand ask them to begin answering.\\nWhen the students are done,\\nthey hand in their answer sheets,\\nand which you collect.\\nYou then compare each answer sheet written by the students,\\nto your second document - the one with the correct answers.\\nYou mark each one as correct or incorrect based on whether\\nthe student had selected the right option amongst multiple choices,\\nor whether the words that they had filled in the blanks for\\nmatches the allowed set of words for that question.\\n\\n### Software Testing\\n\\nAn analogous thing happens in software testing.\\nThe creation of the document containing all the questions is writing the tests.\\nThe creation of the document containing all the answers is\\nwriting the assertions or expectations of the tests.\\nOn the day of the test,\\nthe administration of the test,\\nby distributing the questions,\\ncollecting the answers from the students when they are done,\\nand then performing the comparisons between the students' answers,\\nand the expected answers, is what a test runner does.\\nThe students are the program that we wrote, and is referred to as the system under test.\\n\\nThe are two main differences to be aware of.\\n\\n(1) The first is that the questions (tests) and the answers (assertions/ expectations)\\n**are co-located**, often in the same file, often in adjacent lines of code.\\nThis is because we can programmatically enforce that our program,\\nthe system under test, does not cheat by peeking at the expected answers,\\nwhich is something that we cannot expect of students,\\nshould the teacher distribute the answers alongside the questions!\\n\\n(2) The second difference is something that makes writing tests for software harder,\\nand thus is something to give some thought to.\\nThat is - you are both the teacher and the book author at the same time.\\nYou have written the program - the system under test -\\nand you have also written the tests that verify\\nthat the program is indeed working correctly.\\nIt is human nature to think that our own work is good and therefore correct.\\nThat leaves the door wide open for **bias** towards ones own work to enter,\\nand quite often it does.\\nThis is why software engineers have coined the terms\\n**developer hat** and **tester hat**.\\nIt is essentially a strategy where you pretend to be two different people\\nwith two different roles and agendas.\\nWhen you are wearing the developer hat,\\nyou should think that the program is awesome,\\nand your intent is to write code for the program.\\nWhen you are wearing the tester hat,\\nyou should think that the same program is problematic,\\nand your intent is to find flaws with the program.\\nThis is not an easy thing to do,\\nand is one of the reasons why **writing tests is very hard**!\\n\\n## Coverage\\n\\nLet's continue with the scenario,\\nwith the teacher administering a test to some students -\\nbecause testing and coverage are very closely linked together.\\n\\nNow after administering the test,\\nand grading each student's submission,\\nyou notice that some students have done really well in the tests,\\ndespite not doing well otherwise in class.\\nSimilarly, you notice that some students have not done well at all,\\ndespite normally doing well otherwise in the class.\\nThis raises some interesting possibilities:\\n\\n- Was the test a fair one?\\n- Were there errors in the book that the students were told to study?\\n- Were your prior assumptions about the\\n  students' affinity with the material simply incorrect?\\n\\nOne objective means to ascertain the answer to any of these questions,\\nis to test the test -\\nin other words, devise a meta test.\\nThat is precisely what coverage is about.\\nA simple way to do this in this scenario,\\nis to simply use a fresh copy of the book,\\nand then go through the test yourself.\\nAs the teacher, you would know the answers to all of the questions,\\nand able to answer them correctly,\\nand also know which sentences, bullet points, or diagrams\\nwithin the book you would need to have read or committed to memory\\nin order to answer that question correctly.\\nUse a highlighter to highlight each of these parts of the book\\nas you complete each question.\\nIf a section has been highlighted previously,\\nthat is OK, just highlight right over it -\\nthe more layers there are, the darker the shade of the highlight!\\n\\nAfter completing the entire test in this fashion,\\nyou then simply have to flip through the entire book,\\ncover to cover,\\nand count the ratio of words, sentences, paragraphs, and diagrams\\nwhich have been highlighted, to the total number of those things.\\n\\nAs a teacher, decide what the minimum ratio,\\nor **minimum coverage**, of the books from the test should be.\\nIf this minimum is met, then the test is fine as is,\\nand the test can be deemed fair,\\nand thus its results an accurate enough\\npredictor of knowledge of the book's content.\\nOn the other hand, however,\\nif the coverage is below the minimum threshold,\\nthen this is not the case.\\nEither the test was unfair,\\nand the questions need to be tweaked to get a better coverage;\\nor the book should be edited to contain the right material;\\nor the students should be told that certain material within the book\\nis excluded from the test, and need not be studied.\\n\\n### Software Code Coverage\\n\\nThe other thing that makes writing tests very hard is that it is a lot of work.\\nA lot of work, that does not,\\nactually add any new features,\\nor fix any bugs in the software that you are writing.\\nTesting merely serves the purpose of verifying\\nwhether what we already have written does indeed work.\\nThus, as a developer, who just wants to \\\"make things work\\\",\\nquite often de-prioritise, or even ignore all together, writing tests.\\nThe other catch, is that due to the previously mentioned bias.\\nWhen a developer writes tests for software that he has also written,\\nthe tendency will be for tests to focus on the parts that work well,\\nrather than the parts that do not work well,\\nand focus on parts that are used more often,\\nrather than parts that are used infrequently.\\n\\nThis means of course, that there is often much room left for improvement\\nin writing software tests, and by proxy,\\nroom left for improvement in the software itself.\\n\\nEnter code coverage.\\nCode coverage is one way in which you can test the tests that test your software.\\nThe theory here is that when the entire series of tests are run,\\neach of the functions, lines of code, and branches are all\\naccessed and run.\\n\\nFrom the scenario above,\\nthe \\\"meta-test\\\", where you as the teacher complete the test\\nwhile highlighting the book is equivalent to\\nwhat the code coverage tool does when it instruments the software,\\nand runs the test runner.\\nExamining and calculating the coverage ratios\\nis the report that is output produced by the reporter of the code coverage tool.\\n\\nA code coverage tool programmatically tracks all of\\ncode paths executed when the tests are run,\\nand then outputs a report that shows you which parts of the code\\nhave been executed and which parts have not.\\nThe parts that have not been executed are red flags.\\nAfter running the tests via the code coverage tool,\\na developer should inspect the code coverage report,\\nand identify the parts of the code that have not been executed.\\nFor each one, one of the following three actions are appropriate:\\n\\n1. This code is valid\\n  - Therefore, we should write a test to ensure that this path through the code is executed\\n2. This code is not needed\\n  - This code path cannot be be executed, and it was an oversight during development that caused it to be there in the first place, so delete this code, or otherwise refactor it\\n3. This code is not testable\\n  - This code path **is** a valid part of the software,\\n    but for technical reasons,\\n    it is not possible to write a test for this\\n  - The action in this case is thus more complex:\\n    - Add an inline hint to the code coverage tool to\\n      \\\"ignore\\\" or \\\"skip\\\" this code path,\\n      preferably accompanied by an explanation as to why in a comment\\n    - In the documentation for the software,\\n      add this to a list of things that require manual testing\\n\\n## Badges\\n\\nAdd the following to **README.md**,\\npreferably immediately after the title:\\n\\n```markdown\\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GITHUB_NAME/MODULE_NAME.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GITHUB_NAME/MODULE_NAME)\\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/GITHUB_NAME/MODULE_NAME/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/GITHUB_NAME/MODULE_NAME?branch=master)\\n```\\n\\nThis should render something that looks like the following,\\nand it is very easy for anyone visiting your project's Github page to,\\nat a glance, know the current status of your project.\\n\\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bguiz/plugin-registry.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bguiz/plugin-registry)\\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/bguiz/plugin-registry/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/bguiz/plugin-registry?branch=master)\\n\\nThese indicate to developers considering using your project,\\nthat its maintainer cares about the quality of its code -\\nboth in terms of correctness (tests),\\nand in terms of code coverage.\\n\\nDoing this therefore, is advertising that the project has these attributes,\\nand therefore, is likely to be of high quality.\\n\\n## Contribution Guidelines\\n\\nBe sure to add a contributing section to **README.md**,\\nsuch as this one:\\n\\n```markdown\\n## Contributing\\n\\nThis repository uses the\\n[**git flow** ](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)\\nbranching strategy.\\nIf you wish to contribute, please branch from the **develop** branch -\\npull requests will only be requested if they request merging into the develop branch.\\n```\\n\\nThe intent of this section should be to lay out any ground rules\\nfor other developers who wish to contribute back to this repository.\\nOther developers are quite often much more adept at finding bugs in your software,\\nand finding new ways to use your software,\\nthan you are yourself.\\nMostly because there's one of you,\\nand many of other developers using your software,\\nso it is a statistical certainty.\\n\\nIn any case, if you put your software up on Github,\\nand people actually start using it,\\nyou will soon find yourself receiving bug reports and feature requests.\\nThe awesome thing about open source software is that a fraction of these\\nwill come with an accompanying diff-patch which purports to\\nfix the bug that they have found,\\nor implement the new feature that they have requested.\\n\\nIn the context of Git and Github,\\nthese will come in the form of \\\"Pull Requests\\\".\\nThis happens when another developer \\\"Forks\\\" your Git repository,\\nand then makes a new branch off of his forked copy,\\nwhen he is happy with the changes that he has made,\\nhe then can notify the owner of the originating Git repository about his branch,\\nallowing its maintainer to review, comment on,\\nand copy this branch into his repository, before merging it.\\nAll this can be done either completely via the web user interface on\\n[github.com](https://github.com),\\nor it can be done entirely on the command line using `git`,\\nor somewhere in between.\\n\\nThus it is a good idea to provide developers who are users of your project -\\nand therefore potential contributors back to the project that you maintain -\\nupfront in your README file with:\\n\\n- instructions for how to contribute, and\\n- any ground rules you may have for contributions.\\n\\nFor example, in my projects, where I use the git flow branching strategy,\\nI use the contributing section to point out that branches and pull requests should\\nbe off the `develop` branch;\\nbecause in an absence of this instruction,\\nthe default or assumption would be to branch off `master`.\\n\\n## Plublicise\\n\\nAfter adding:\\n\\n- continuous integration\\n- linting\\n- testing\\n- code coverage\\n- badges\\n- contribution guidelines\\n\\n... your open source project is now at its prime,\\nand it is more professional than it has ever been before.\\nIt would be a shame now then, that after all this hard work,\\nno one knows about it, and no one uses it.\\n\\nSo you should tweet about it,\\npost it on Reddit or Hacker News, et cetera.\\nMake sure that someone else knows about it!\\n\\nThe main question is not really about whether you should,\\nbut it is about when you should.\\nThere is no need to post about `v0.0.1`,\\nthe very first iteration, that is more of a proof of concept for yourself,\\nand you do not really want to publicise.\\nInstead post about your project when it is reasonably high quality,\\nand is past the proof of concept stage.\\nOf course, whenever there is a new release that passes a major milestone,\\nhas a breaking API change, et cetera,\\nit is time to post about it again.\\n\\n## Effort\\n\\nAfter reading through all that,\\nit becomes apparent that going through this process is a rather arduous task,\\nand requires a lot of effort.\\n\\nThere is no denying that.\\nHowever, it is a matter of prioritising where to apply the efforts.\\nOne thing that is for certain though,\\nis that the later these tasks are put off,\\nlarger the effort is to do these things.\\n\\nOne strategy to maintain a balance between active development,\\nand tasks related to being a good steward of your open source project:\\n\\nSimply do the minimum to ensure that all of these are in place,\\nbut empty at the get go.\\nThat is, as soon as the project is started,\\nor as soon as it gets promoted from proof of concept,\\nto something you wish to publish/ publicise.\\n\\nAt that inception point, set up the `lint task`.\\nSet up the `test` task, but write just one or two tasks.\\nSet up the `cover` and `coveralls` tasks, but ignore the fact that coverage is close to zero.\\n\\nIntersperse active development with writing tests, and fixing lint errors.\\n\\nOver time, the bugs identified by the tests will get squashed,\\nand the coverage starts creeping up toward a reasonable threshold.\\nAt this point, we can switch on Travis and Coveralls for this project,\\nand add the badges to the README.\\n\\nEven later, you can add the contribution guidelines section to the README,\\nand post about your project on social to publicise it.\\n\\ntl;dr= Break up the effort put in, into smaller chunks.\\n\\n## Iterate, iterate, iterate!\\n\\nIn general, with software development,\\nit is a good idea to break up large tasks into\\nsmaller, achievable chunks of work.\\n\\nThis allows multiple developers to work towards the same goal\\nwithout stepping on each others' toes too much.\\nMore importantly though, it allows the project to maintain momentum.\\n\\nThis applies not just to developing new features or fixing bugs in a piece of software,\\nbut also to all these other tasks -\\nlinting, testing, coverage, documentation, badges, contribution guidelines, and publicising -\\nthat one has to do in being a steward of open source software.\\nThese tasks all take a lot of time,\\nand some of them, such as writing tests,\\ncan be extremely prolonged.\\nIf there is a long way to go to catch up for a project,\\ndon't give up, and continue with the status quo.\\n\\nInstead, simply iterate.\\nFor example, if your project has no tests at all,\\naim to improve code coverage a few percent at a time, starting from zero.\\nOr perhaps even just have a new rule where any new features or bugs fixed,\\nfrom now on should have a new test case to cover the new feature or fix.\\n\\n## Not just for maintainers\\n\\nNow, all these things are not just for project maintainers -\\nyou do not even need to have started your own open source project\\nin order to be a good steward for that project!\\n\\nThe **open nature** of open source means that\\n**anyone can contribute** to any project,\\nso there is nothing stopping you from creating a pull request to add\\nlinting, testing, coverage, or documentation to a project.\\nJust be sure to ask its maintainer if they are amenable first!\\n\\n## Platform Specific\\n\\n- [NodeJs

the\\n[official install instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation)\\nfor installing NodeJs, but you are running into problems with the installation.\\n\\n## Installation Problems\\n\\nFor the Windows platform, NodeJs allows you to choose the directory in which to install the platform, so you will not face any issues.\\n\\nFor Linux and Mac, there is an issue,\\nbecause the installer defaults to `/usr/local` or `/usr/lib`,\\nwhich are directories that require `sudo` access to write files to.\\n\\nThus, whenever you do a global installation of a node module,\\nit attempts to install it in a subdirectory which requires `sudo` access.\\n\\n### `EACCESS`\\n\\nWhen the NodeJs platform is installation in a directory that requires `sudo access`,\\nany global installs will result in a bunch of errors of type `EACCESS`,\\nwhich you will see output to your terminal.\\n\\nA rookie mistake, upon seeing these, would be to ignore them,\\nand simply repeat your previous global installation command,\\nthis time with the `sudo` command in front of it.\\nAfter all, after the error messages,\\nthis is precisely what the suggested fix is.\\n\\nThis will appear to work at first, as the installation will succeed.\\nHowever, it sets you up for inevitable failure down the road,\\nas sooner or later the need to use `sudo` will **spread** -\\nto pretty much **all** NodeJs related activities,\\nand you might find that unless you start your IDE using `sudo`,\\nyour projects cannot build.\\nNow you are in over your head!\\n\\n## Solutions\\n\\n### Compile from source\\n\\nIf you are the sort who is unfazed when dealing with C compilers,\\nand are a command line whiz, then this is *the* option for you.\\nChances are, however, if you fall into this category,\\nyou would have defaulted to this route anyway -\\ninstead of getting stuck and reading this article!\\n\\n### homewbrew\\n\\nIf you are on Mac, and you already have [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed,\\nthen you can simply do:\\n\\n```bash\\nbrew install node\\n```\\n\\n... to install the latest version of NodeJs.\\n\\n### NVM\\n\\nFor everyone else, there is Node Version Manager.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, what NVM does is to install the NodeJs platform\\nin a subdirectory of your user home directory,\\nby compiling from source -\\ntaking care of all the required steps.\\nIt then sets up symbolic links and\\nvarious environment variables to ensure that it can run.\\nIt also allows you to install multiple versions of NodeJs side by side,\\nand switch between them rather effortlessly.\\n\\nThe main thing that we care about in all of this, however,\\nis simply the fact that NVM is the easiest way to install the NodeJs platform\\nin a directory that does not require `sudo` access.\\n\\n## Installing NVM\\n\\nProject page: https://github.com/creationix/nvm\\n\\n* Open a terminal.\\n* Mac only:\\n  * Enter the following command: `touch ~/.profile`\\n  * This creates an empty file in your home directory if it is not already present,\\n    and is a prerequisite to installing NVM\\n* Linux only:\\n  * If you are using Linux, this not required,\\n    because a `~/.bashrc` file is used instead,\\n    and would already exist by default.\\n  * If, however, you are using a different shell than `bash`,\\n    such as `zsh` or `ksh`,\\n    ensure that the appropriate terminal start script contains\\n    `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh`.\\n* Follow the \\\"Install Script\\\"\\n  [instructions](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script)\\n* Now close the terminal, and open a new one\\n  * This is done to ensure that the environment variables\\n    are set up correctly in the new shell\\n\\n### Installing a default NodeJs\\n\\n* In the terminal, enter the following commands:\\n  * `nvm install 0.10`\\n  * `nvm alias default 0.10`\\n  * `nvm use default`\\n* You may choose any version you like:\\n  Instead of `0.10`, you could choose `0.11` or `0.12`, or any specific patch number!\\n* now close the terminal, and reopen it.\\n* if you enter: `node -v`\\n  * you should see something similar to: `v0.10.29`\\n  * if you see something else like: `node: command not found`\\n    * something has gone wrong with your nvm installation,\\n      go back and check you step\\n\\nThat's all!\\n\\n### Look ma, no `sudo`!\\n\\nNow whenever you do a global installation,\\nyou need not use `sudo`,\\nbecause NodeJs is installed in a subdirectory of your home directory,\\nwhich doesn't require `sudo` access to write files.\\n\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install --global npm\\n```\\n\\nThis should install `npm` in the global `node_modules` directory,\\nwithout a hitch.\\n\\n#### Caveat\\n\\nIf you have previously installed NodeJs using another method,\\nand have used `sudo npm ...` commands before,\\nyou might still run into problems,\\nwhere global installations without `sudo` continue to fail.\\n\\nThe first action you should take, to overcome this, is to find where\\nthe previous installation was located and delete it.\\n\\nThe second action you should take, is to find a directory in your home directory,\\nnamed `.npm`, and ensure that the `root` user does not own any of those files.\\nThe following command should help you with that.\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo chown -R $( whomami ) ~/.npm\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIf you are using Linux or Mac,\\ninstall NodeJs using NVM to save yourself from a lot of headaches!\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/2015/02/02/project-which-file-belongs-to-nodejs-bower\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n

scaling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) is a thing.\\n\\nPut the two together, and ...\\n\\nTurns out that 9-slice scaling isn't so easy to do in SVGs,\\nbecause SVGs use a coordinate system where it is not possible to\\nspecify dimensions in terms of both percentages and fixed values.\\nThat is exactly what you need though, for 9-slice scaling!\\n\\nFortunately, the SVG specification includes an escape hatch of sorts,\\n`<foreignObject />` which allows you to embed something other than an SVG within itself.\\nWe can use this to put in a HTML fragment,\\nwhich of course can make use of CSS properties to\\nspecify dimensions in terms of both percentages and fixed values!\\nOnce we have got the right positions and size using HTML/ CSS,\\nwe can then place an SVG within it.\\n\\nThat sounds extremely inefficient, doesn't it?\\nTurns out there is a neat little trick in play here,\\nenabled by `<symbol />`, `<use /`> and `xlink`.\\nIn the outer SVG, you can define a `<symbol />`,\\nwhich contains the full graphic, in a `<g />`, which needs to be sliced.\\nSubsequently define nine `<symbol />`s each of which have a `viewBox`\\nto restrict their display to a particular *slice* of the full graphic.\\nWithin the symbol, we have a `<use /`> with an `xlink` to reference the original graphic.\\nThis is actually a big deal, because what happens behind the scenes,\\nto make all this work, is that the SVG is only rendered once,\\nand is thus quite efficient,\\nbecause each of the nine slices do not need to re-render the original graphic.\\nThis is not the first time which we will make use of this,\\nbecause when we use `<foreignObject />`, which contain inner `<svg />`s,\\nwe have `<use /`> with an `xlink` once again,\\nbut this time referencing the sliced graphic `<symbol />`s instead.\\n\\nIt is quite amazing that the reference still works despite going\\n`SVG --> HTML --> SVG`.\\nThank you to whoever ensured that this was part of the SVG specification.\\nWhen I did that for the first time, I held my breath,\\nhalf expecting it not to work at all!\\n\\n## Enough rambling, show me the sauce!\\n\\nI have posted the working SVG [on this gist](https://gist.github.com/bguiz/e3a6d0561f90735d1459).\\n\\n[![svg-9slice-scaling.svg](https://gist.githack.com/bguiz/e3a6d0561f90735d1459/raw/2564816ff0930478264426e7e2826b3d84149675/svg-9slice-scaling.svg)](https://gist.githack.com/bguiz/e3a6d0561f90735d1459/raw/2564816ff0930478264426e7e2826b3d84149675/svg-9slice-scaling.svg)\\n\\nClick

       },\n        \"body\": \"\\n## Open chrome dev tools\\n\\n`Ctrl+Shift+C` or `Ctrl+F12`\\n\\nOr, right-click on any element in a web page,\\nand select \\\"Inspect Element\\\" from the drop down menu.\\n\\n## Elements Pane\\n\\nAt the top of the \\\"Dev Tools\\\" pane,\\nyou will see a series of tabs.\\nThe first of these is the \\\"Elements\\\" tab.\\nIt is usually selected by default\\nwhen you first open up the pane.\\n\\nOn the left you see the DOM inspector.\\n\\nOn the right you see the CSS inspector.\\n\\n### Inspect element\\n\\nThe DOM is a tree-like structure of all the elements that your web page is made up of.\\n\\nTo jump to s particular point within the DOM,\\nyou right-click on any element in a web page,\\nand select \\\"Inspect Element\\\" from the drop-down menu.\\nThis will expand the DOM tree to where the element is.\\n\\nThis DOM tree is a live representation of the document.\\nMeaning that if you change it,\\nthe page that is rendered will update to reflect those changes.\\nRight click on any element within the DOM tree and pick \\\"Edit as HTML\\\",\\nand make whatever changes you like to it.\\nWhen it loses focus, the changes are made,\\nand you should see the updated element displayed in the web page.\\nYou can use any of the other options, such as \\\"Add ATrribute\\\" or \\\"Edit Attribute\\\".\\nYou can even drag and drop the elements around, and delete them.\\n\\n### Inspect CSS\\n\\nWhen you have any element selected in the DOM tree within the Elements panel,\\nthe CSS panel will update to display the styles for that element.\\n\\nThis works in a manner very similar to the the DOM tree,\\nin that it is a live representation of the document's styles too.\\nSo when you change it, those changes get reflected in the web page immediately.\\n\\nThe other thing worth noting is that CSS styles that are applied to any one element\\nare actually sourced from potentially multiple CSS files,\\nand if so the order is quite important.\\nThe styles view shows you not only what the styles are,\\nbut also which specific CSS file and line number they come from.\\n\\nIf you click on the check boxes next to each line of CSS,\\nyou can toggle the individual style rules on and off.\\nIn addition to toggling the existing styles on and off,\\nyou can also edit the values by clicking on them,\\nand then typing (or selecting) the new value.\\nYou can even add a new line to an existing CSS rule.\\n\\nThese are the basic techniques upon which you can debug your CSS.\\n\\nTo add a completely new rule, click on the `+` icon\\nat the top right corner of the styles panel.\\n\\n#### Link to sources\\n\\nFor each CSS rule, to the right, there should be a file name,\\nfollowed by a `:` and then a line number, all underlined.\\n\\nIf you click on this link,\\nit opens up the \\\"Sources\\\" pane,\\nopening the the CSS file in which this rule was defined,\\nand jumps to the right line number.\\n\\n#### Colours\\n\\nWhen a line in any CSS rule contains a colour,\\nthe text representation of that colour (as found in the CSS file is displayed).\\nIn addition to this, there is also a small box,\\nfilled with that colour.\\nCLick on this box to reveal a pop up colour selector,\\nwhich you can use to select a new colour instead of having to\\ntype the value by hand after looking it up elsewhere.\\n\\n#### Forcing pseudo classes\\n\\nCSS comes with several pseudo classes that allow us to define custom CSS rules\\nwhich activate only when the user is interacting with it.\\nThe most common one of these is `:hover`,\\nwhich activates only when the mouse is over the element.\\n\\nWe can use the styles panels to force a particular pseudo class to activate\\nby click on the icon between the `+` icon and the gear icon,\\nwhich looks like a box with a mouse cursor on it.\\n\\n#### Box model\\n\\nOne of the peskiest things when it come to working with CSS and HTML\\nis understanding the box model of each element -\\nhow exactly do `padding`, `border`, and `margin` all stack up in each case?\\nIf you are like me and need constant reminding about how it works,\\nthen you will find the diagram of the box model\\nwhich is displayed here extremely handy to have!\\n\\n## Console Pane\\n\\nThe logs any output from the web page (usually produced by Javascript),\\nand also acts as a Javascript [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).\\nThis read-eval-print-loop can be thought of as a Javascript command line,\\nwhich executes within the context of the current state of the web page being displayed.\\nThis is most often useful when you wish to debug your web page.\\n\\nTry typing any Javascript commands that you like into the Console,\\nhit `Enter` and the output from that command,\\nif any, will be printed below it.\\n`console.log();` and `console.assert();` are your friends!\\n\\nChrome's Console is pretty smart and does not simply print out a string\\nrepresentation of everything.\\nIf you `console.log();` a large or complex Javascript object,\\na brief snippet of the object is printed, prefixed with an arrow.\\nIf you click on the arrow, you can drill down into the object.\\nSimilarly, if you `console.log();` a DOM element,\\na brief snippet of that element is printed, prefixed with an arrow,\\nwhich you can click to drill down through the element -\\n(this works in exactly the same way as the DOM panel in the Inspector pane).\\nTry this:\\n\\n- `console.log(document.body);`\\n- `console.assert(!document);`\\n\\nTry some more advanced queries, where you can write any Javascript,\\nwhich and it will run as if the currently loaded page has run it.\\n\\n- `10 + 20` (outputs 30)\\n- `document.querySelectorAll('p')` (selects all `<p />` DOM nodes in the page)\\n\\n## Sources Pane\\n\\n### Editing CSS files\\n\\nIf you open up one of the CSS files used by your site,\\nand edit it, it has the same effect as editing it in the Styles panel\\nwithin the Elements pane - the web page updates to reflect the changes immediately!\\n\\nHowever, there is a reason for you to make your edits here instead of in the Styles panel:\\nYou can actually save these changes to disk,\\nbypassing the need to `Alt+Tab` back to your IDE or text editor.\\n\\nThink about this for a moment.\\nYou have literally got yourself a WYSIWYG web page editor,\\nright under your noses all along!\\n\\nWhen you save the file (`Ctrl+S`), however,\\nyou are only saving it to Chrome's own internal storage.\\nYou aren't saving it to where this file is being served up from.\\n\\n> **Why?**\\n>\\n> When you edit the source code for a web page,\\n> it usually consists *.html, *.css, and *.js files sitting on a folder on your disk.\\n>\\n> However, it is not best practice to open the files directly in your browser\\n> directly from the file system.\\n> Instead you should be running a simple web server,\\n> and point your browser at this web server.\\n>\\n> The easiest way to do this on most *NIX systems,\\n> is to `cd` into the folder from which you intend to serve files,\\n> and then run this command: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.\\n> If you prefer a NodeJs based solution,\\n> [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)\\n> is pretty much the same thing.\\n> Next you simply visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080),\\n> or whatever URL the server starts up in, in your browser.\\n>\\n> In any case, since your files are being served from a web server,\\n> if you want to tell Chrome to save file to a folder on your disk,\\n> you will need to tell Chrome where that folder is.\\n\\nRight-click within a file, and select \\\"Local Modifications\\\" from the pop up menu\\nto see the list of all the changes made to the file while editing within the browser.\\nWhen you click to expand each one, it shows you a \\\"diff\\\",\\nin a style similar to source code version control systems such as *svn* or *git*.\\nIf you click on the \\\"Revert\\\" link next to one of them,\\nChrome will roll back all changes made to the file after that point,\\nrestoring a previous state.\\n\\nIf you wish to save the file to a folder on the disk,\\ninstead of locally within a browser,\\nright-click within the file, and select \\\"Save As\\\" from the pop-up menu.\\nThen simply navigate to the folder where\\nthe original file being served is located, and overwrite it.\\nIf you wish to do this very frequently,\\nrather than on a per-file basis,\\nit might be worthwhile adding a permanent mapping to Chrome's Dev Tools' settings.\\nTo do this, `(gear icon) --> Workspace --> Folders --> Add Folder`\\nNext, with the folder selected, click \\\"Folder Options\\\",\\nand enter the mapping between the URL path and file folder location.\\n\\n### Viewing Javascript FIles\\n\\nViewing Javascript files works in the same way as CSS files.\\nIt also happens in the Sources pane.\\nThe main difference is that instead of getting hyperlinks to open up a particular file in the\\nInspect CSS panel of the Elements pane,\\nhyperlinks to particular Javascript files with a line number to open up to\\nwill be found in the output in the Console pane.\\nIf you click on one of these links in the console,\\nthat Javascript file will open up in the Sources pane,\\nand jump to the right line number.\\n\\nThis usually happens when the Javascript code outputs something\\nvia the `console` global object,\\nor an error/ exception is thrown,\\nbringing us to the next topic: Debugging.\\n\\n### Debugging Javascript\\n\\nDebugging is the process of finding our where there has been a divergence between\\nwhat the computer has executed and what the original intent of the code was.\\nIn other words, finding out where and why some code did this when it should have done that instead.\\n\\nIn the context of Javascript executing in a browser,\\nthe most basic or rudimentary way to do this is to simply\\npepper your code with `console.log` statements,\\nand then observe the output in the Console pane.\\nWhen you think you have found the cause,\\nsimply edit the Javascript file to fix the error, and refresh the page.\\nThis approach is quite effective for trivial problems -\\ntrial and error can get you a long way in programming!\\n\\nHowever, there are niftier tools at your disposal than that\\nmade available to you in the Sources panel in Dev Tools,\\nsuch as breakpoints, and the ability to execute code in the context of a breakpoint,\\nand the ability to step through code line by line.\\nIn other words, pretty much what you would expect an IDE\\nof any programming language to be able to do.\\n\\n#### Break points\\n\\nSetting a breakpoint is quite easy form the sources pane.\\nSimply scroll to any particular line in a Javascript file,\\nand then click on the margin (where the line number is).\\nYou should see the line number highlighted in blue.\\nClick on the same line number again to remove that breakpoint.\\n\\nBreakpoints can also be disabled.\\nThis allows you to easily remember where the breakpoint was previously,\\nwhich is useful when you wish to turn it off only temporarily.\\nTo do this, simply right-click on a break point,\\nand select \\\"Disable breakpoint\\\" from the pop-up menu.\\nThe breakpoint highlight should turn from blue to a faded blue.\\n\\nBreakpoints can also be conditional;\\nmeaning that when the breakpoint is hit,\\na certain expression is evaluated,\\nif that expression evaluates to a *truthy* value,\\nthe breakpoint activates.\\nOtherwise, the breakpoint is skipped, and execution continues as per normal.\\nTo do this, right-click on a break point,\\nand select \\\"Edit breakpoint\\\" from the pop-up menu.\\nThen type any valid Javascript expression into the text box which appears -\\nit would be most useful to use variables that should be present,\\nwithin the current scope,\\nwhen this line of code executes.\\nThe breakpoint highlight should turn from blue to orange.\\nConditional breakpoint can also be disabled,\\nusing the same method as disabling a regular breakpoint.\\nThe only difference is that their highlights are a faded orange colour.\\n\\nFor your convenience, all break points that have been set within the app\\nare listed under a \\\"Breakpoints\\\" section in the right column of the Sources pane.\\nClick on them to jump to the particular file and line where the break point has been set.\\nToggle the check box on each break point to enable/ disable that one.\\n\\n#### Exceptions\\n\\n*Pause on exceptions* can be toggled by clicking on the\\nbutton that is a pause symbol within a stop-sign like octagon.\\n\\nThis button has three states:\\n\\n- Off (grey)\\n- Pause on all exceptions (blue)\\n- Pause on uncaught exceptions (red)\\n\\n#### Minified code\\n\\nWhen deploying a Javascript application,\\nit is standard practice to *minify* the Javascript source code\\nusing libraries such as `uglify.js`.\\nDoing so has two main purposes:\\n\\n- Decreasing file size: Makes the size of the files that the browser needs to download much smaller.\\n- Obfuscation: Makes it harder (but not impossible)\\n  for another developer to understand and therefore copy your code\\n\\nThis, of course makes debugging your own minified code harder.\\nFortunately, dev tools can make this easier for you to do.\\n\\nLook for the `{}` icon in the bottom of the sources pane.\\nIt should be just to the left of the status text,\\nwhich reads something like \\\"Line 123, Column 45\\\".\\nThis is the pretty-print button,\\nand simply expands minified code to include white space\\n(new line characters and tab stops).\\nIt doesn't however, un-obfuscate the variable names.\\n\\nThe pretty print mode makes it far more easy to set breakpoints on minified code,\\nand also to see exactly where the exception occurs during when\\n*pause on exception* is turned on.\\n\\nIf the code is your own, however,\\nyou should not rely on pretty print mode.\\nInstead you should ensure that your build tool outputs source maps\\nfor you minified code.\\nWhen source maps are present,\\nChrome knows about the mappings between the minified code\\nand the actual source code,\\nand therefore makes it much easier to work with when debugging.\\n\\nA full discussion on source maps is beyond the scope of this article.\\nHowever, [this article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/)\\nis an excellent resource which explains what source maps are,\\nand how to use them, in greater detail.\\n\\n#### Paused state\\n\\nWhen in pause state, either because of a *pause on exception*,\\nor because a breakpoint was set,\\nor while stepping through code line by line,\\nyou can inspect the state of the currently executing Javascript.\\n\\nHover your mouse over any variables to see it value.\\nTo find the value of more complex expressions,\\nyou can select the entire expression, then hover over it,\\nor you can type the expression into the console.\\n\\nTo type into the console, you can either switch to the Console pane,\\nor you can bring up the mini console,\\nby simply pressing the `Esc` key on your keyboard while still in the Sources pane.\\n\\nApart from inspecting the current state,\\nduring paused state, you can control the execution flow.\\nIf you are familiar with debugging from within an IDE,\\nthis should be quite familiar!\\n\\nThe control flow buttons are located in the top-right corner of the Sources pane\\n\\n- *Pause/play*: Resumes normal execution when paused. Pauses at current point of execution during normal execution\\n- *Step over*: Executes the current line of code, and goes to the next one.\\n- *Step into*: If the current line of code calls any functions, step into the execution path of that function\\n- *Step out*: Skip execution till the current function scope exits\\n- *Disable/enable all*: Disables or enables all breakpoints\\n- *Pause on exception*: Controls whether paused state is automatically entered upon an exception being thrown\\n\\n## Network Pane\\n\\nWhen you are on a web page, and you open up Dev tool and go to the Network pane,\\nit is usually empty.\\nThis is because you need the pane to be open before loading the page\\nin order for the network activity to be logged by the pane.\\nThis is different from the other panes,\\nwhere any activity is that occurs while Dev tools are not open,\\nbecomes accessible once it is opened.\\n\\nThis pane is pretty straight forward.\\nIt has various columns, not unlike the columns in the GUI of\\na file system browser in an operating system.\\nThe columns are:\\n\\n- Path\\n  - The path on the server that was requested\\n- Method\\n  - The HTTP method for that path (GET/ POST/ PUT/ PATCH/ DELETE, etc.)\\n- Status\\n  - The HTTP response code and status text (\\\"200 OK\\\"/ \\\"404 Not Found\\\", etc.)\\n- Type\\n  - The response file type (\\\"text/javascript\\\"/ \\\"image/png\\\", etc)\\n- Initiator\\n  - Which other resource triggered the request for this resource\\n  - Click on the hyperlinks to open the Sources pane and jump to the file and line of code\\n- Size\\n  - The download size and the actual size of each resource\\n- Time\\n  - The download time and the latency time of each resource\\n- Timeline\\n  - Displays a the initial and final loading time for each resource\\n    such that all the resources together look like a Gantt chart.\\n\\n### Inspecting resources\\n\\nClick on any of the resources,\\nand the table will collapse,\\nsuch that only the first column is visible (\\\"Path\\\").\\nThe remaining area should now display a more detailed copy\\nof the network activity for that resource.\\n\\nThis will include the request and response HTTP headers,\\nthe request body (if any),\\nand the response body,\\nplus more information about the timing.\\nNon-text files, such as images, also have a preview which display them visually.\\n\\n### Disable cache\\n\\nWHile developing you might notice that after you edit some of your files,\\nand then refresh the page in the browser,\\nthe changes that you just made may not have had any effect.\\nOr perhaps some of the changes had an effect,\\nand the others simply did not, even though you know that they should have.\\nOne reason why this sort of this thing happens is caching that the browser does by default.\\nWhen a browser access any resource, it saves a copy of that resources to disk,\\nand when the same resource is loaded subsequently,\\ninstead of making a HTTP request, and receiving the response,\\nwhich uses up some bandwidth and takes up some time;\\nit can be more efficient by simply reusing the copy saved to disk instead.\\nIt chooses to do so based on how long ago\\nthe resource was last actually loaded from the server.\\nYou can tell when this is happening by looking at the *Status* column\\nin the Network pane.\\nAny resource listed as \\\"304 Not modified\\\" has not been downloaded again.\\nThis behaviour is great is you are browsing someone else's website,\\nbecause you are going to appreciate the faster surfing.\\n\\nHowever, when you are browsing your own website as you are developing it,\\nit is a totally different game.\\nYou will be refreshing sometimes several time in a minute,\\nand each time you are expecting the page to behave slightly differently.\\nIn such a situation, disabling the automatic caching behaviour is probably what you want.\\n\\nTo do this click on the gear icon in the top right corner of Dev tools.\\nThis brings up the settings panel.\\nUnder *General*, the the first option should be\\n\\\"Disable cache (while DevTools is open)\\\".\\nEnsure that this check box is ticked, then close the settings panel.\\nFrom now on, you whenever Dev tools is open,\\nwhich should be the case when you are developing your own website,\\nand probably will not be the case when you are browsing someone else's website,\\ncaching is disabled.\\n\\n### PageSpeed\\n\\n[PageSpeed](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pagespeed-insights-by-goo/gplegfbjlmmehdoakndmohflojccocli?hl=en)\\nis a Chrome extension which adds a brand new pane to DevTools,\\nthe *PageSpeed pane*.\\nThis pane complements the Network pane well.\\n\\nUpon opening the PageSPeed pane in Dev tools,\\nthe pane downloads the current page and runs several programmatic tests on it,\\nand gives the page a score out of 100.\\nFurther to this, it also tells you where points were lost,\\nby listing suggestions about what you can do to improve the performance of the page.\\nFor example, common ones would include:\\n\\n- Minify and concatenate Javascript\\n- Minify and concatenate CSS\\n\\nMinification and concatenation are important concepts in improving the\\ntotal time taken to download any text-based asset on a web page.\\nUsually you tend to do these for any Javascript files and CSS files.\\n\\nUtilities such as [UglifyJs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2),\\nhelps with Javascript minification tasks.\\nThese utilities strip out any unnecessary white space,\\nand shorten parameter names and function names,\\namong other techniques to output an almost unreadable,\\nbut technically equivalent Javascript code.\\nThe output code is much smaller as it has fewer characters.\\nIn addition to this, there are multiple input Javascript files,\\nwhich result in just one output Javascript file.\\nThis is important, because downloading one large file is always faster than\\ndownloading multiple smaller files,\\neven when the sum of the sizes of the smaller files is equal to the size of the larger file.\\nThe reason for this is that browsers have a self-imposed limit\\non the total number of downloads it can do concurrently (usually about eight).\\nIn addition, each time the browser downloads a resource,\\nit needs to make a separate HTTP request and receive a separate HTTP response.\\nEach request and response consists of a fairly significant overhead in terms\\nof [HTTP headers](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-headers-for-dummies--net-8039),\\nwhich will be more or less the same between multiple Javascript files,\\nand thus is a waste of bandwidth, latency time, and download time.\\nConcatenating (joining) all the smaller files into one\\ntherefore usually results in a significant page load speed improvement.\\n\\n## Timeline pane\\n\\n### Frames panel\\n\\nFrames per second (FPS) is a measure of the number of times the browser\\ncan render a web page each second.\\nGenerally speaking, the higher the number,\\nthe better your web page.\\nThe general consensus is that anything above 60 fps is **excellent**,\\nany thing above 30 fps is **good enough**,\\nanything less than 30 fps is **bad**,\\nand anything less than 15 fps is **very bad**.\\nThese numbers depend upon characteristics of the human eye -\\nhow frequently does an image have to refresh itself before\\nthe illusion of smooth motion is perceived by the eye.\\n\\nWhen a page is slow, the FPS drops, and once it drops below certain thresholds,\\npeople looking at the page begin to notice that it \\\"stutters\\\".\\nThus, when developing a page,\\nit is important to be sure that the FPS stays above the target threshold.\\nThings that can have a negative impact on FPS:\\n\\n- Javascript execution\\n- Rendering (painting to screen)\\n- CSS style complexity\\n\\nOpen up the Timeline pane, and select \\\"Frames\\\" on the left to open the Frames panel.\\nNext, click on record.\\nNow, trigger various events that cause the p[age to re-render,\\nand observe the graph fill up.\\nNext, click the record button again to stop recording.\\n\\nThe histogram represents the time taken for each thing to happen,\\nand the when the height exceeds each FPD marker is significant.\\n\\nThe 60 fps line is exceeded when the frame takes more than 1/60 seconds to complete,\\nand likewise, the 30 fps line is exceeded when the frame takes more than 1/30 seconds.\\n\\nEach bar comprises of various colours:\\n\\n- Yellow: Javascript execution\\n- Purple: Style & position calculations\\n- Green: Painting to screen\\n- Transparent: Other miscellaneous tasks\\n\\nWhen a task spikes above the 60 fps threshold,\\nthat makes it a possible candidate for further investigation.\\nWhen a task spikes above the 30 fps threshold,\\nthat makes it a definite candidate for further investigation.\\nIf the spike was, say mostly yellow,\\nthat would indicate that CPU profiling would be most relevant here.\\nIf the spike was, say mostly purple or green,\\nthen it is worth reviewing the complexity of the CSS rules applied\\non the relevant elements.\\n\\n### Memory panel\\n\\nThe memory panel works in the same way as the frames panel,\\nexcept that instead of measuring the FPS,\\nit measures the total memory usage of the page.\\nThis is useful to identify which actions on the page result in higher memory usage,\\nand more importantly which ones cause memory leaks.\\n\\n*Memory leaks* occur when the application uses up more and more memory\\nas the page continues its execution of Javascript.\\nSometimes increased memory usage is expected,\\nfor example, when the page has loaded more data than before.\\nHowever in some cases, the memory just goes up anyway,\\neven though the page is not doing much.\\nThis is caused when memory has been allocated to store certain data,\\nbut when that data is no longer needed,\\nthat memory is left alone, instead of being freed.\\n\\n## Profiles pane\\n\\n### CPU profiling\\n\\nIn the Profiles pane, select \\\"Collect Javascript CPU Profile\\\",\\nthen press the start button below.\\nNow interact with the page in some way\\nwhich causes Javascript which we wish to profile to execute,\\nthen click on the stop button.\\n\\nNext you will see a  which lists all the function that were called,\\nand how much time was spent executing each of them.\\nYou can click each of the column headers to sort the table by that attribute,\\nbut most likely what you will want (also the default),\\nis the \\\"Self\\\" execution time as a percentage of the total execution time,\\nin decreasing order.\\nThe functions which take the longest to execute are the prime candidates\\nfor performance optimisation.\\nHowever, sometimes very small simple functions which get called many times\\nwind up at the top here.\\nIn cases like this, sort by the \\\"Total\\\" execution time,\\nand see which functions take the longest to execute,\\nincluding the duration of the functions which they invoke.\\nBy looking at this list, in combination with the previous one,\\nplus some guesswork, you should be able to identify which functions\\nare calling the very frequently executed functions.\\nIf this is indeed the case,\\nperhaps the performance optimisations should be done in the calling function.\\n\\nYou can inspect each of these functions by clicking on the hyperlink\\nin the last column of each one,\\nwhich will open the Sources pane,\\nopening to the selected file, and jumping to the relevant line number.\\n\\nThe idea here is that you use the Timeline pane to detect which frames are slow,\\nat a higher level - identifying where potential performance bottlenecks are;\\nand then subsequently use the Profiles pane to identify exactly\\nwhere these performance bottlenecks occur.\\n\\n### Memory profiling\\n\\nIn the Profiles panel, select \\\"Take Heap Snapshot\\\",\\nthen press \\\"Take Snapshot\\\".\\nYou will now see a summary of all the different things that the page had stored\\nin memory at that point of time, organised by type.\\nNow interact with the page in some way that causes the memory leak to occur.\\nThen click on record button, in the bottom-left corner,\\nand this takes another heap snapshot.\\nThen select the second snapshot (the newer one),\\nand in the bar a the bottom,\\nclick on \\\"Summary\\\" and change this to \\\"Comparison\\\".\\n\\nThis should now show all the objects in the heap that were in the second snapshot,\\nbut not in the first.\\nInspect this list to identify any objects which should no longer be hanging around,\\nand should have been removed from memory.\\nCommon offenders include event listener functions\\nattached to DOM elements which have been removed from the page,\\nand DOM elements removed from the page,\\nbut whose references are stored in variables somewhere.\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/articles/designing-a-restful-api\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n

parameters (optional)\\n- Headers (optional)\\n- Body (optional)\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\nReST stands for *Representational State Transfer*.\\nWhile the *R* does not stand for *Resource*, I wish it did,\\nbecause designing a good RESTful API is much easier when\\nwhen you think about organising around resources first and foremost.\\n\\nThe idea of organising around resources is to identify the objects\\nwhich you wish to communicate about between the client and server.\\nCHances are, you have already though about this at some level\\neither on your back end server code,\\nor your front end client code.\\nYou may have defined classes that represent certain objects,\\nand defined database schemas that represent those same objects.\\nIf you have, you have already modelled your resources.\\n\\nOnce you have identified what your resources are,\\nyou can give each one of them a *base URL*\\nwithin your API.\\nFor example, if you have a `Customer` resource,\\nthe `base URL` for it could be `/api/v1/customers`.\\nAn `Address` resource might have a *base URL* of `/api/v1/addresses`.\\n\\nOnce you have your *base URL*,\\nthe next step is to create an *instance URL* for each resource.\\n\\n- `/api/v1/customers` - refers to all customers\\n- `/api/v1/customers/:id` - refers to a single customer\\n  whose ID matches the number at the end of the URL\\n\\n\\n## Add HTTP verbs\\n\\nSo far, we have identified what resources we have,\\nand what the *base URL* and *instance URL* for each one should be.\\n\\nThe next key part of RESTful API design is the actions.\\nThis is where HTTP verbs come into the mix.\\n\\nTypically, the actions that one wishes to perform of any resource falls into\\none of four operations:\\n\\n- *Create* - create a new instance of a resource\\n- *Read* - access one or more existing instances of a resource\\n- *Update* - modify an existing instance of a resource\\n- *Delete* - destroy an existing instance of a resource\\n\\nA non RESTful way of designing an API could be to\\nsimply append the name of the operation to the *instance URL*.\\nFor example, to delete a `Customer` with an ID of `123`,\\nthe URL could be:\\n\\n`/api/v1/customers/1/delete` (wrong)\\n\\nInstead, make use of HTTP verbs in order to do so.\\nThis [list of commonly used HTTP verbs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods)\\nis a handy resource.\\n\\nIn the context of RESTful API design, however,\\nwhat we are most concerned about is how they map to the four types of operations\\nwhich we wish to perform on resources.\\n\\n- *Create* - `POST` or `PUT`\\n- *Read* - `GET`\\n- *Update* - `PATCH` or `PUT`\\n- *Delete* - `DELETE`\\n\\n### Delete\\n\\nComing back to the example above,\\nto delete a `Customer` with an ID of `123`,\\nthe HTTP request could be:\\n\\n`DELETE /api/v1/customers/123` (correct)\\n\\ninstead of using `GET`, the default HTTP verb, with the name of the action in the URL:\\n\\n`GET /api/v1/customers/1/delete` (wrong)\\n\\n### Read\\n\\nThe read operation is just as simple as the delete operation:\\n\\n`GET /api/v1/customers/123`\\n\\nWith read operations, however, it is common place to want to read not just one\\ninstance of a resource in one request, but rather multiple ones.\\nFor this, we issue a `GET` request on the *base URL* instead of the *instance URL*.\\n\\n`GET /api/v1/customers`\\n\\nThis should receive a response with all of the customers.\\nIf, for example, this is excessive,\\nas is likely to be the case in a real world application,\\nsimply use query parameters to filter the request.\\n\\n`GET /api/v1/customers?page=0&perPage=30`\\n\\nThe example above might be what you issue to obtain a list of customers\\nto display in a paginate form.\\n\\n### Create\\n\\nCreate and update are slightly more complex than read and delete,\\nbecause they each involve two HTTP verbs,\\nwhich are used in two different types of situations\\nwhen creating or updating resources.\\n\\nCreate operations could use either `POST` or `PUT` HTTP verbs.\\n\\nWhen you create a new object in the front end,\\nyou will quite often know all the attributes from the user input.\\nAll, that is, except for the ID of that object.\\nSince an ID is a key that should be unique among all instances of a particular resource,\\nthe correct place to determine an ID for any resource would be in the database layer,\\nas it has the facilities to do so,\\nbecause it maintains an index of the IDs (or primary keys) of all instances of a resource.\\n\\nThus in order to create a new customer, the HTTP request might be\\n\\n```\\nPOST /api/v1/customers\\n\\n{\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"Brendan\\\",\\n    \\\"points\\\": 100\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet's say, however, that your front end is somehow already privy to the ID\\nfor a resource that is about to be created,\\nperhaps from a previous request.\\nIn this case, a `PUT` would be appropriate:\\n\\n```\\nPUT /api/v1/customers/123\\n\\n{\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"Brendan\\\",\\n    \\\"points\\\": 100\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the default case, however, `POST` is preferred.\\n\\n### Update\\n\\nSimilar to create, update operations also make use of two different HTTP verbs -\\n`PATCH` and `PUT`\\n\\nWhen the front end wishes to update a resource,\\nit should already have a copy of that resource,\\nand thus will know its ID.\\nHowever, when updating, it can choose to either:\\n\\n- update just a select number of properties of that resource, or\\n- update the entire resource, overwriting the existing copy\\n\\nTo update only select properties, use `PATCH`:\\n\\n```\\nPATCH /api/v1/customers/123\\n\\n{\\n    \\\"points\\\": -10\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo overwrite all properties, use `PUT`:\\n\\n```\\nPUT /api/v1/customers/123\\n\\n{\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"bguiz\\\",\\n    \\\"points\\\": 90\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Recap\\n\\n- *Create* - `POST` or `PUT`\\n    - When you wish to create the object,\\n      but wish to allow the server to decide its ID (primary key), use `POST`\\n    - When you know the entire object already, including its ID, use `PUT`\\n- *Read* - `GET`\\n    - When accessing multiple resources at once, use the *base URL*\\n      instead of the *instance URL*\\n    - Use query parameters to restrict or filter multiple resources if necessary\\n- *Update* - `PATCH` or `PUT`\\n    - When you wish to submit just the parts of the resource that have changed,\\n      use `PATCH`\\n    - When you wish to resubmit the entire resource,\\n      and have the existing one overwritten, use `PUT`\\n- *Delete* - `DELETE`\\n\\n## HATEOAS\\n\\nWhat a wonderful acronym, eh?\\nIt stands for *Hypertext as the Engine of Application State*.\\nIt means that each request to a resource,\\nshould provide links to other related resources.\\nIn theory, a front end application should be able to navigate\\nthrough all other related resources after being pointed at the first one.\\n\\nThe problem with this,\\nand with other aspects of RESTful APIs for that matter,\\nis that there is no standard specifying exactly how this should be done.\\nIn fact, there are many who will have different opinions on which HTTP\\nverbs are appropriate to use when.\\n\\nThis brings us to the next thing: Standardisation\\n\\n## Standardisation\\n\\nOne of the main problems with designing a RESTful API,\\nis that everyone has their own interpretation,\\nand execution of it.\\n\\nThis is partly due to the inherent complexities,\\nand often real world application trade off that need to be made,\\nwhich have optimisation and speed face off against sticking to the specification.\\n\\nHowever, it is *mostly* due to the fact that there is no specification to begin with.\\nAll we really have is an\\n[academic paper by Roy Fielding](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm)\\nwho coined the term, *Representational State Transfer*.\\nWhile this laid excellent ground work on a conceptual basis,\\nit left too much room for interpretation in technical implementation.\\n\\n![JSON API logo](http://jsonapi.org/images/jsonapi@0.7x.png)\\n\\n[JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/)\\nis one of the many different standards that have built upon RESTful API design.\\nIt builds upon two things: Using JSON as the serialization format,\\nand using a RESTful API.\\n\\nIn doing so, I believe that it has also done a great job of codifying RESTful APIs.\\nIn addition, it also\\n[includes a solution for side-loading](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure-compound-documents \\\"Compound Documents\\\"),\\nrather than in line embedding, of related data as part of its specification.\\nThis is a particularly useful feature that is not part of standard RESTful APIs,\\nbut very useful to have in practice.\\n\\nThus, if you are designing a RESTful API,\\nI would strongly recommend starting with JSON API.\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/articles/angularjs-emberjs-compare\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"title\": \"AngularJs vs

to do it with.\\nThere are plethora of them out there -\\n[TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) lists 15 \\\"pure Javascript\\\" implementations,\\nand a total of over 60 MV\\\\* frameworks.\\nHow do you confidently pick from them all?\\n\\nMost would start by reading blog posts and various reviews online,\\nbut that only gets you so far,\\nas the majority of them are written by someone who belongs to\\none camp or the other,\\nand quite often roots very strongly for their chosen framework.\\nIt was quite hard to find any objective opinions.\\n\\n## The Book\\n\\nFaced with this task myself,\\nI began to collect opinions from both sides,\\nand filter out the vitriol.\\nMore importantly, I tried out and built prototype applications with them.\\nIn light of time, I only did this for two frameworks:\\nAngularJs and EmberJs.\\n\\nI have assembled what I have learned into a short 50 page book,\\nwhich you can\\n[read online](http://angularjs-emberjs-compare.bguiz.com/),\\nor [read as an ebook](https://leanpub.com/angularjs-emberjs-compare/).\\n\\n![AngularJs vs EmberJs on Leanpub](https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/angularjs-emberjs-compare/large?1415362544)\\n\\n## Do you actually need a SPA?\\n\\nThe first thing you will need to do is decide whether you really need an MVC framework.\\nThis boils down to two questions:\\n\\n- Do you want \\\"single page\\\", or do you want \\\"application\\\"?\\n- Do you want a presentation layer, or do you want the full structure of models, views, and controllers?\\n\\nIf what you are building can be more accurately described as an app\\nthan a website, then sure, a SPA framework such as AngularJs or EmberJs is apt.\\nOtherwise, it is probably overkill.\\nFor example while you can use AngularJs/EmberJs to create a blog,\\nyou are probably better off with a simpler framework or library.\\n\\nIf you wish for Javascript to mostly just do the presentation logic -\\nviews and templating -\\nyou are probably better off with a framework like Famo.us or ReactJs,\\nas they focus on that exclusively.\\n\\n## Which SPA is best?\\n\\nLooking online on this topic, most posts fit one of these two categories:\\n\\n- Framework X is the best framework because it has these features\\n- Framework Y is the lousiest framework because it has these problems\\n\\nThe latter type is even even less helpful when they focus on edge cases,\\nwhich you are bound to run into in *any* framework.\\n\\nReading these articles might give you some perspective on each framework,\\nbut what is lacking is detailed a side-by-side comparison of the parts of each framework.\\nThis is precisely what [my book](https://leanpub.com/angularjs-emberjs-compare/ \\\"AngularJs vs EmberJs - a comparison\\\") does.\\n\\nHowever, in this post, we will skip that,\\nand get into the guts of how to make that decision right away.\\nThe implied premise of this is that there is **no best framework**,\\nbut there most certainly *is* a **best framework for your particular app**.\\n\\nHere are some questions you may want to mull over when picking a framework.\\n\\n### 1.

Modernizr and yepnope.js are great for this.\\n- Standards\\n    - Read the specs (or articles that summarise them), and adhere to the standards imposed by them\\n- Libraries\\n    - Use a library such as jQuery or Modernizr that have already have cross browser polyfills and shims\\n- Resets\\n    - Using a CSS reset ensures a common baseline across all browsers\\n- Matching vs progressive enhancement\\n    - Rather than trying to make the display and beahviours match, allow them to be different, with a reasonable baseline\\n- Testing\\n    - Use browsershots to eyeball how the page displays in many different browsers at once\\n- Transpilers\\n    - Use SASS/ LESS/ Stylus or another CSS preprocessor that automatically creates vendor-specific prefixes for style rules\\n    - Many ES6/ES5 to ES3 transpilers include shims or polyfills for language features that are not supported in older browsers, or behave slightly different in various modern browsers\\n\\n### Notes\\n\\n- Use Modernizr when you want a library that provides both feature detection and polyfills. Use yepnope.js when you only want feature detection, and you wish to bring your own polyfill.\\n- Feature detection works by testing for the type and existence of various properties on `window`, `document`, or DOM elements created on the fly (and sometimes other techniques too).\\n- Polyfills work by first doing feature detection, and if a feature is missing natively, implementing it using Javascript\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n- Articles\\n    - [The Developer’s Guide To Writing Cross-Browser JavaScript Polyfills](http://addyosmani.com/blog/writing-polyfills/) - by Addy Osmani\\n    -

beginner's crash course in Javascript,\\nand apply it to a very worthwhile cause.\\nYou might even make some money by doing it!\\n\\n## The Objective\\n\\n[Kiva](http://kiva.org) is an organisation that enables anyone to participate as\\n[microcredit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit) lenders.\\n\\nYou could get started with Kiva by using their search function;\\nalternatively, you could also get started by using Kiva's API\\nplus some Javascript.\\n\\nThe objective is to be able to perform a query on Kiva's data\\nto select one or more of Kiva's partners,\\nto make micro-credit loans to.\\nBy making loans to these organisations,\\nyou are helping to improve the lives of some of the most poor people in the world,\\nand therefore doing some social good.\\n\\nYou might ask, why it is important to be selective of the partner organisations that you make loans to.\\nThese loans come with a high risk -\\nprimarily because the borrowers do not have to put up any collateral as security for the loans;\\nbecause they quite often do not have much by way of collateral to begin with!\\nThis means that if they default on their repayments,\\nthere is no recourse, and the loaned amount needs to be written off as a loss.\\nThe good thing is that some of Kiva's partners have a better track record than others\\nwhen it comes to managing micro-credit loans effectively.\\nAs a lender, it is in your best interest to pick the more reputable partner organisations.\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\nFire up [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/).\\n(If you do not use Chrome, you can still work through this, but the instructions could be slightly different - YMMV)\\nNext, open developer tools - hit `Ctrl+Shift+C`.\\nYou should see a new pane open up, with various sub-panes.\\n\\nThe pane we are most interested in for this exercise, is \\\"Console\\\".\\nThe console gives you access to a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop).\\nMany web developers use this to find out why the web sites that they build are misbehaving.\\nWe, however, will not be building any websites,\\nand will simply be using this to execute Javascript code.\\n\\n## Loading data\\n\\nVisit [http://api.kivaws.org/v1/partners.json](http://api.kivaws.org/v1/partners.json).\\n\\nWhen you visit that URL, Chrome quickly realises that is **not** a web page,\\nthat you are visiting, but actually JSON.\\nJSON is a text-based data exchange format which is very common on the web,\\nbecause it can be read and manipulated easily using Javascript,\\nwhich is exactly what we will be doing!\\n\\nChrome does not display JSON though, only web pages,\\nso it puts the JSON into a minimal web page.\\nUnfortunately, this does not work in our favour,\\nas we will need to extract the JSON back out from the web page.\\nSo go to the console,\\nand enter the following two lines of code:\\n\\n\\n\\n    var txt = document.querySelector('pre').innerHTML;\\n    var json = JSON.parse(txt);\\n\\nThe first line finds where Chrome has put the JSON into the web page,\\nand extracts it, putting it into a variable named `txt`.\\n\\nThe second line then takes `txt`, which is presently just a string of text characters,\\nand parses it as JSON, storing it in another variable,\\nthis time named `json`.\\n\\n## Objects and Arrays\\n\\nWe have successfully used the Developer Tools Console as a Javascript REPL,\\nand created a JSON object.\\n\\nLet us inspect the object to see what it contains.\\nTo do this, simply enter `json` into the console,\\nand Chrome prints out a summary of the object.\\n\\n\\n\\n    json;\\n    > Object {paging: Object, partners: Array[341]}\\n\\nThis means that the `json` object contains two child properties,\\n`paging`, and `partners`.\\nWe do not care about `paging`, but we do want to inspect `partners`.\\nTo query a property of an object we use dot-notation...\\nin this case `json` dot `partners`:\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners;\\n    > Array[341]\\n\\nThis partners array contains information about **all** of the Kiva partners.\\nThis is not very helpful though, as none of us have the time to look through over 300 items.\\n\\nLet us just look at the very first partner.\\nTo query an element of an array, we use square bracket notation...\\nin this case `json.partners` open square bracket `0` close square bracket.\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners[0]\\n    > Object {id: 1, name: \\\"East Africa Beta\\\", status: \\\"closed\\\", rating: \\\"0.0\\\", due_diligence_type: \\\"Full\\\"…}\\n\\nNote that the index of the first element of the array is zero.\\nArrays in most programming languages, Javascript included, start at zero, not one.\\nSimilarly, the last index of the array is its length **minus one**:\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners.length\\n    > 341\\n    json.partners[340]\\n    > Object {id: 417, name: \\\"Emerging Cooking Solutions Zambia ltd\\\", status: \\\"active\\\", rating: \\\"Not Rated\\\", due_diligence_type: \\\"Experimental\\\"…}\\n\\nIn the first command, we use dot notation to query the `length` property of `json.partners`.\\nIn the second command, we use square bracket notation to query the last element of the `json.partners`.\\n\\nThe more astute might have noticed that we were able to use dot notation to query\\na property on an array, and perhaps got a little confused.\\nThat is because, in Javascript, all arrays are objects too!\\n(not all objects are arrays though).\\n\\n## Functions and Functional Programming\\n\\nNow it is time to level up to functional programming.\\nWe are not going to be doing the full deal here,\\nand indeed there are other languages much better than Javascript for functional programming.\\nJavascript does, however, support parts of the functional programming paradigm that we are interested in,\\nwhich are the functions that operate on arrays.\\n\\nThis is, however, available only on modern browsers,\\nthat implement the newest version of the Javascript specification (ES6).\\nTest that your browser is good enough by entering the following command:\\n\\n\\n\\n    Array.prototype.filter\\n    > function filter() { [native code] }\\n\\nIf your output is different, for example, if it is `null` or `undefined`,\\nthen you will need to get [a better browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/),\\nor make sure you have updated to the latest version.\\n\\nOnce you are done, we shall get cracking with `filter`, `sort`, and `map`.\\n\\nIf you are curious what the `prototype` property is,\\nyou will need to [do some](http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/12/understanding-prototypes-in-javascript/)\\n[reading on](http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/understanding-javascript-prototypes/)\\n[your own](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype) -\\nit is a more advanced concept, and we will not be covering that concept here.\\n\\nThe only thing that we are concerned with, about prototypes,\\nis that `Array.prototype` provisions all Javascript arrays with a number of functions,\\nincluding `filter`, `sort`, and `map`.\\n\\n### Filter\\n\\nThe first thing that we want to do is make sure that we find partners that are active.\\nInactive partners on Kiva do not have any active fund raisers for you to contribute to.\\n\\nAll arrays have a `filter` property that is made available to them through the `Array` prototype.\\nThis function takes in three parameters - but we only care about the first one.\\n\\nWhat happens when `filter` is called is:\\n\\n- takes the original array, and loops over each of its elements, from first to last\\n- for each of the elements, it calls the function, with the element as the first parameter\\n    - in this case, we call the element `partner`\\n- if the return value is `true`, that element is added to the output array; otherwise it is discarded\\n- the value of the output array, is therefore, always a subset of the original array\\n\\n\\n\\n    var outputArray = originalArray.filter(function(element) {\\n        return true /* or false */ ;\\n    });\\n\\nNow let us decide which properties we wish to filter upon,\\nso let us just inspect the first partner on the full list:\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners[0]\\n    > Object {id: 1, name: \\\"East Africa Beta\\\", status: \\\"closed\\\", rating: \\\"0.0\\\", due_diligence_type: \\\"Full\\\"…}\\n\\nIn Chrome, if you click on the small triangle next to the output,\\nthe object will expand to show all of its properties.\\nThis one happens to have a property of `status` set to `closed`.\\nWe do not want that, we only want partners whose status is set to `active`.\\nWithout any filters, we have 341 partners.\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners;\\n    > Array[341]\\n\\nNext we add a filter so that only active partners are included,\\nand now we are down to 253 partners:\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners.filter(function(partner) {\\n        return partner.status === 'active';\\n    });\\n    > Array[253]\\n\\nThat list is still too big, so let us narrow it down further.\\n\\nWe inspect the first object by repeating the previous query and adding `[0]` to the end.\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners.filter(function(partner) {\\n        return partner.status === 'active';\\n    })[0];\\n    > Object {id: 9, name: \\\"KREDIT Ltd.\\\", status: \\\"active\\\", rating: \\\"4.5\\\", due_diligence_type: \\\"Full\\\"…}\\n\\nExpand the object, and we now see a new property,\\nwhich was not present on the closed partner we looked at earlier - `profitability`.\\nLet us add a filter for that too.\\n\\nNow we wish to return `true` based on satisfying two conditions.\\nThe way to do this is using the [Boolean AND](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction) operator,\\nwhich is represented using `&&` in Javascript.\\nHere we add a second condition, that a partner's profitability must be at least 0.1%:\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners.filter(function(partner) {\\n        return partner.status === 'active' &&\\n            partner.profitability > 0.1;\\n    });\\n    > Array[110]\\n\\nNow let us inspect the first element in the array output above.\\nThere is one more property that we want to filter partners on,\\nthe rating that Kiva assigns to each of them,\\nwe only want partners who are rated more than 3.5 stars out of 5 stars.\\n\\nFollowing the steps above, we might be tempted to do the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners.filter(function(partner) {\\n        return partner.status === 'active' &&\\n            partner.profitability > 0.1 &&\\n            partner.rating > 3.5;\\n    });\\n\\nHowever, this can lead to incorrect results, as the JSON returned by Kiva\\nreturns the value of `rating` as a string (text) instead of a number.\\nThus, we need to convert it to a number first.\\nIn Javascript, we do this using `parseFloat`:\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners.filter(function(partner) {\\n        return partner.status === 'active' &&\\n            partner.profitability > 0.1 &&\\n            parseFloat(partner.rating, 10) > 3.5;\\n    });\\n    > Array[24]\\n\\nBased on our filters alone, we have narrowed down our total number of partners from 341 to just 24!\\n\\n[Documentation for Array.prototype.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)\\n\\n### Sort\\n\\nOnce you have grokked `filter`, `sort` should come pretty easily.\\n\\nWhat happens when `filter` is called is:\\n\\n- takes the original array, and loops over each of its elements in an order determined by the sorting algorithm\\n- as it does so, the algorithm will need to determine for each pair of elements, which comes before the other\\n- for each pair of elements, it calls the function, with a pair of elements as its first and second parameter\\n    - in this case, we call the elements `p1` and `p2`\\n- if the return value is less than zero `p1` is sorted closer toward the first element of the array than `p2`\\n- the output array always contains the same elements as the input array, but usually in a different order\\n\\n\\n\\n    var outputArray = inputArray.sort() {function(element1, element2) {\\n        return 0 /* or any other number computed by comparing element1 to element2 */ ;\\n    }};\\n\\nApplying this to our Kiva dataset, we do:\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners.filter(function(partner) {\\n        return partner.status === 'active' && partner.profitability > 0.1 && parseFloat(partner.rating, 10) > 3.5;\\n    }).sort(function(p1, p2) {\\n        return p2.profitability - p1.profitability;\\n    });\\n    > Array[24]\\n\\nBy subtracting the profitability of the second partner from the first partner another,\\nwe always get a negative number when the first partner's profitability is higher,\\ntherefore sorting the array in decreasing order of profitability.\\n\\n[Documentation for Array.prototype.sort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort)\\n\\n### Filter again\\n\\nNow that we have sorted the partners in decreasing order of profitability,\\nwe can perform another filter, because we are only interested in the top ten amongst them.\\n\\nThe only thing that is different this time around,\\nis that we now ignore the first parameter in the function,\\nand only care about the second parameter that is passed in.\\nThe second parameter is the index of the element within the array.\\nSince the array is already sorted by profitability,\\nto get the top ten, we simply have to select the partners whose indices are zero through nine:\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners.filter(function(partner) {\\n        return partner.status === 'active' && partner.profitability > 0.1 && parseFloat(partner.rating, 10) > 3.5;\\n    }).sort(function(p1, p2) {\\n        return p2.profitability - p1.profitability;\\n    }).filter(function(partner, idx) {\\n        return idx < 10;\\n    });\\n    > Array[10]\\n\\nIn fact, this was the motivation for sorting the array in the previous step.\\nI was a little sneaky by leaving that out until now,\\nbut it is a lot easier to explain now!\\n\\n### Map\\n\\nNow we have narrowed it down to just ten partners,\\nand we can inspect the output array in Chrome -\\nit is almost ready to use!\\n\\nHowever, there is just one last step.\\nLet us make it a little bit easier to use the output.\\nReading that data within the context of a JSON object has a high geek factor,\\nbut it is not really that useful, is it?\\n\\nNow that we have a filtered list,\\nwhy not go to the web page for each of these partners?\\n\\nGo to the [main Kiva site](http://kiva.org),\\nand browse to any partner's page,\\nthen look at the URL in the address bar.\\n\\ne.g. `http://www.kiva.org/partners/99`\\n\\nEyeballing this URL, an educated guess would be that the URL for a partner is\\n\\\"http://www.kiva.org/partners/\\\" followed by the partner's ID.\\n\\nTo confirm this, open the first element from the output of the \\\"Filter Again\\\" step above,\\nand copy the its `id` attribute, and paste it into the address bar,\\nreplacing the existing ID that was there.\\nThe new partner page loads, and the partner name, and all the other information matches.\\nSuccess!\\n\\nNow let us use this information to construct the URLs for each of the Kiva partners.\\n\\nAfter grokking `filter` and `sort`, `map` should come pretty easily.\\n\\n- takes the original array, and loops over each of its elements, from first to last\\n- for each of the elements, it calls the function, with the element as the first parameter\\n    - in this case, we call the element `partner`\\n- whatever the value the function returns will be added to the output array\\n- the value of the output array, is therefore, always a transformation of the input array\\n\\n\\n\\n    var outputArray = inputArray.sort() {function(element) {\\n        return element /* or any thing you compute from element */ ;\\n    }};\\n\\nApplying this to our Kiva dataset, we do:\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners.filter(function(partner) {\\n        return partner.status === 'active' && partner.profitability > 0.1 && parseFloat(partner.rating, 10) > 3.5;\\n    }).sort(function(p1, p2) {\\n        return p2.profitability - p1.profitability;\\n    }).filter(function(partner, idx) {\\n        return idx < 10;\\n    }).map(function(partner) {\\n        return 'http://www.kiva.org/partners/'+partner.id;\\n    });\\n    > Array[10]\\n\\nIf you click on the triangle next to the output array,\\nChrome expands it, and since it recognises the strings as URLs,\\nit turns them int links, making it easy for you to click on them.\\n\\n[Documentation for Array.prototype.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)\\n\\n## Mixing it up\\n\\nLet us say that you have a different set of criteria:\\n\\n- We do not care about the profitability of a partner\\n- We require a higher Kiva rating of the partner, and require Kiva to have done a full due diligence check on them\\n- We want to sort them in order of their default rate\\n\\nWe can then use the same structure as we had earlier,\\nbut modify the criteria within the first filter function,\\nand the sort function.\\n\\n\\n\\n    json.partners.filter(function(partner) {\\n        return partner.status === 'active' &&\\n            partner.due_diligence_type === \\\"Full\\\" &&\\n            parseFloat(partner.rating, 10) > 4.0;\\n    }).sort(function(p1, p2) {\\n        return p1.default_rate - p2.default_rate;\\n    }).filter(function(partner, idx) {\\n        return idx < 10;\\n    }).map(function(partner) {\\n        return 'http://www.kiva.org/partners/'+partner.id;\\n    });\\n\\nThe second filter function is not really necessary any more,\\nas the total number of partners that match the more stringent criteria is now less than ten anyway.\\n\\nWe keep the map function as it is, because we are still extracting the URL.\\n\\nNow we a have a completely different set of Kiva partners than we did using the\\nprevious selection method.\\n\\nWrite down your own criteria in selecting partners,\\nand then write some Javascript code to run it.\\n\\nIf you are having trouble, leave a comment below this post.\\nAlternatively, if you have written some code for selecting a Kiva partner that you would like to show others,\\nleave a comment too!\\n\\n## Now, donate!\\n\\nIt is all fine and dandy to learn some new Javascript tricks,\\nbut up until now it is merely an academic exercise.\\n\\nIf you wish to make some real world impact,\\nand do some social good,\\nopen up each of the partner URLs that you now have in your output,\\nand browse the loan recipients that are with this partner.\\n\\nWhile I think it makes to write code to select the Kiva partners you prefer,\\nI do not think it makes sense to do the same when selecting individuals or groups to make micro-credit loans to.\\nMy rationale is simple:\\nIt makes the most sense to select Kiva partners based on quantitative metrics,\\nwhich code is good at analysing and comparing;\\nand it makes the most sense to select Kiva partners based on qualitative metrics,\\nwhich is better done by a human brain than through code.\\n\\nFor example, when I looked through all of the potential recipients of micro-credit loans\\nthrough each of the Kiva partners that I had selected,\\nI was not selecting them based on easily quantifiable metrics such as\\ntheir gender,their age, or even how close they were to reachign their funding target.\\n\\nInstead I selected them based on their story;\\nwhat they were planning to do with their loan if they received it.\\nI was looking out specifically for those who had an entrepreneurial spark of some sort,\\nsuch as the a guy who wanted to purchase an amplifier for his live music performances.\\nI was also looking out for personal qualities that indicate they were likely to succeed in their endeavour,\\nsuch as the girl who had  already started one business and was looking to start a second one.\\n\\n## Q & A\\n\\n**Q**: Can't I just use the \\\"Advanced Search\\\" function?\\n\\n**A**: Why, yes, of course you can - but that would not have been half as fun!\\n\\n**Q**: I seems counter-intuitive to make API requests in a browser's developer console. Why not just use `curl`/ `wget`/ `NodeJs`/ `Python`, et cetera?\\n\\n**A**: Sure, you can use all of those. You are an experienced software developer, you can use whatever tool you feel fit! This tutorial was intended for absolute beginners, and thus expressly avoided the need to install any tools. It is safe to assume that almost everyone reading this has access to a web browser!\\n\\n**Q**: Does it matter what order I perform the `sort`, `filter`, and `map` in?\\n\\n**A**: Yes and no, but most of the time, yes it does matter. In this example, if you crop filter for the first ten elements, before you perform the sort, you most certainly are **not** going to get the top ten. Similarly, if you map before anything else, the results will be incorrect, because the functions expect provider objects, not strings.\\n\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/articles/javascript-quirks\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"title\": \"Javascript quirks, tips, et cetera\",\n          \"date\": 1409089320000,\n          \"comments\": true,\n          \"tags\": [\n            \"javascript\",\n            \"quirks\",\n            \"snippets\"\n          ],\n          \"source\": \"src/documents/articles/javascript-quirks.html.md\",\n          \"slug\": \"javascript-quirks\",\n          \"url\": \"/articles/javascript-quirks\",\n          \"urlAliases\": []\n        },\n        \"body\": \"\\n## Slice on array-like objects\\n\\n[MDN: `Array.prototype.slice` for Array-like objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice#Array-like)\\n\\n    function incorrect() {\\n        return arguments.slice(1);

good enough for a demo!\\n\\n### Serve the Platform Script File\\n\\nOnce again, we could serve this file using a static file server,\\nprovided we knew the domain ahead of time.\\nSince this is a demo,\\nwe work this out at run time.\\nSo we need to use a templating engine to render it,\\npassing in the domain as a template variable.\\n\\n    serverApp.engine('js', ejs.renderFile);\\n    serverApp.get(platformScript, function(req, res) {\\n        res.render('server'+platformScript, {\\n            serverHost: serverHost,\\n            platformScript: platformScript,\\n        });\\n    });\\n\\n    // views/server/3rd/platform.js\\n    'use strict';\\n    /*globals document, console, XMLHttpRequest*/\\n\\n    console.log('hello from server');\\n\\n    (function(global) {\\n        var serverHost = '<%= serverHost %>';\\n        var elements = document.querySelectorAll('.foo-widget');\\n        for (var i = 0; i < elements.length; ++i) {\\n            var el = elements[i];\\n            processElement(el);\\n        }\\n\\n        function processElement(el) {\\n            var id = el.getAttribute('data-foo-id');\\n            var processed = el.getAttribute('data-foo-processed');\\n            if (!id || processed === 'done') {\\n                //skip this one as it has either already been processed, or lacks an ID\\n                //This is done to ensure logic is not executed twice in the event that the\\n                //user erroneously embeds the script tag more than once on a single page\\n                console.log('skipping element:', el);\\n                return;\\n            }\\n            var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\\n            xhr.onload = function() {\\n                el.innerHTML = 'foo-widget: '+this.responseText;\\n                el.setAttribute('data-foo-processed', 'done');\\n            };\\n            xhr.open(\\\"GET\\\", serverHost+'/api/3rd/foo-widget/init/'+id);\\n            xhr.send();\\n        }\\n    }());\\n\\n### Respond to API Requests from Widgets\\n\\n    serverApp.get('/api/3rd/foo-widget/init/:id', function(req, res) {\\n        var id = req.params.id;\\n        res.send('api response #'+id);\\n    });\\n\\n## Testing it all together\\n\\nRun the servers that we just created:\\n\\n    node index.js\\n\\nFire up a browser, and open up the developer tools:\\n`Ctrl+Shift+C` in both Chrome and Firefox.\\nSwitch to the network tab, so that you are ready to view captured AJAX requests.\\n\\nNow go to [`http://0.0.0.0:54101/`](http://0.0.0.0:54101/).\\n\\nThis should serve up `index.html` of the 3rd party site.\\n\\nYou should also see a AJAX request made to\\n[`http://0.0.0.0:54100/`](http://0.0.0.0:54100/)\\nfor each widget that you have on the page in the network tab.\\n\\nReplace `0.0.0.0` with your IP address, which can be obtained by running\\n`ifconfig` on *nix and `ipconfig` on Windows.\\n\\nA snapshot of the work done so far:\\n[bguiz/embeddable-widget-demo/tree/v0.0.1](https://github.com/bguiz/embeddable-widget-demo/tree/v0.0.1)\\n\\n## Add more features\\n\\nSo far, we have the ability to embed a snippet of HTML served by the platform server\\nonto a page served by another (3rd party) server;\\nusing minimal snippets.\\n\\nThat is not all that we need to do though -\\nwe still need to add the ability for these widgets to interact with the\\nplatform server.\\n\\nWe also would like to be able to add styles to the widgets.\\n\\nFinally, let us make the platform server capable of serving up\\nwidgets for multiple platforms (or namespaces).\\n\\n### Widgets invoke platform APIs\\n\\nAfter `fooWidget.setAttribute('data-foo-processed', 'done');`,\\nadd the following:\\n\\n    // views/server/3rd/foo/platform.js\\n    var fooWidgetButton = fooWidget.querySelector('.bar-button');\\n    if (!fooWidgetButton) {\\n        return;\\n    }\\n    var fooWidgetButtonFunction = function() { /* ... */ };\\n    if (fooWidgetButton.addEventListener) {\\n        fooWidgetButton.addEventListener('click', fooWidgetButtonFunction);\\n    }\\n    else if (fooWidgetButton.attachEvent) {\\n        fooWidgetButton.attachEvent('onclick', fooWidgetButtonFunction);\\n    }\\n    else {\\n        fooWidgetButton.onclick = fooWidgetButtonFunction;\\n    }\\n\\nTurns out that when using raw Javascript,\\nwithout the aid a framework or a library like jQuery,\\nresponding to a simple click event can be quite tricky to do properly!\\n\\nThe implementation of the click handler function would be:\\n\\n    var fooWidgetButtonFunction = function() {\\n        //TODO disable the button temporarily to prevent double-click\\n        var barXhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\\n        barXhr.onload = function() {\\n            var result = JSON.parse(this.responseText);\\n            console.log(result);\\n            var barPara = fooWidget.querySelector('.bar');\\n            if (barPara) {\\n                barPara.innerHTML = JSON.stringify(result);\\n            }\\n        };\\n        barXhr.open('POST', serverHost+'/api/3rd/foo/widget/'+id+'/bar?partyId='+partyId);\\n        var content = {\\n            fooId: id,\\n        };\\n        content = JSON.stringify(content);\\n        barXhr.setRequestHeader('Content-type', 'application/json');\\n        barXhr.send(content);\\n    };\\n\\nThis sends off another `XMLHttpRequest`,\\nthis time a `POST` with a post body.\\n\\nWe add the following API to accept this `POST` request.\\nAt the moment, it is not much more than a glorified `echo` API -\\nsufficient for the pruposes of this demo though:\\n\\n    // index.js\\n    serverApp.post('/api/3rd/:platform/widget/:id/:action', function(req, res) {\\n        var id = req.params.id;\\n        var action = req.params.action;\\n        var partyId = req.query.partyId;\\n        var platformWidgetInitPath = platformWidgetInitPathTemplate.replace(':platform', req.params.platform);\\n        res.send({\\n            action: req.params.action,\\n            success: true, //In this demo, all actions succeed\\n            content: req.body,\\n        });\\n    });\\n\\nAdd the following constant to the top of the file.\\n\\n    // index.js\\n    var platformWidgetInitPathTemplate = '/3rd/:platform/widget-init.html';\\n\\n### Adding inline CSS styles to widgets\\n\\nIn the platform Javascript file,\\nwe create a new function that will inject a `style` tag into the DOM\\nthat contains the CSS that we require.\\n\\n    // server/3rd/genbook/platform.js\\n    function injectStyles() {\\n        var css = '<%= inlineCss %>';\\n        var style = document.createElement('style');\\n        style.type = 'text/css';\\n        if (style.styleSheet) {\\n            style.styleSheet.cssText = css;\\n        }\\n        else {\\n            style.appendChild(document.createTextNode(css));\\n        }\\n        var head = document.head || document.querySelector('head');\\n        head.appendChild(style);\\n    }\\n\\nOf course, it would be crazy to write the CSS right here,\\nin a Javascript string literal,\\nso we shall defer that to the templating engine and the platform server.\\n\\n    // index.js\\n    serverApp.get(platformScriptPathTemplate, function(req, res) {\\n        var partyId = req.query.partyId;\\n        var platformScriptPath = platformScriptPathTemplate.replace(':platform', req.params.platform);\\n        var platformStylePath = platformStylePathTemplate.replace(':platform', req.params.platform);\\n        //TODO inserting the CSS file into the platform script like this is quite wasteful\\n        //This is a prime candidate for refactoring or at the very least result caching\\n        fs.readFile(path.normalize(platformStylePath), function(err, data) {\\n            data = ((!err && data && data.toString()) || '').replace( /(?:\\\\r\\\\n|\\\\r|\\\\n)/g , ' ');\\n            res.render('server'+platformScriptPath, {\\n                partyId: partyId,\\n                serverHost: serverHost,\\n                platformScript: platformScriptPath,\\n                inlineCss: data,\\n            });\\n        });\\n    });\\n\\nHere, we modify the platform server route which serves the platform Javascript\\nto read the platform CSS file, strip it off new line chaarcters,\\nand then pass it to the templating engine.\\n\\nThis is a little hacky, and only fit for demonstration puposes.\\nThings to do would include:\\n\\n- Minify the CSS\\n- Escape other special characters\\n- Cache the CSS response\\n\\n\\n\\n    // index.js\\n    var platformScriptPathTemplate = '/3rd/:platform/platform.js';\\n    var platformStylePathTemplate = __dirname+'/views/server/3rd/:platform/platform.css';\\n\\nThese constants should also be added to the top of the file.\\n\\n### Refactor to serve multiple widget platforms\\n\\nWe have already done this in the previous steps!\\n\\nBy declaring the constants named `somethingTemplate`,\\nand then replacing the `:platform` part of it with the `:platform`\\nthat we extract from the request path;\\nwe can now create many platforms by simply adding\\na new folder with the same name as the platform.\\n\\n## Testing interactions between the embedded widgets and platform server\\n\\nA snapshot of the work so far:\\n[bguiz/embeddable-widget-demo/tree/v0.0.2](https://github.com/bguiz/embeddable-widget-demo/tree/v0.0.2)\\n\\n... or see the complete set of changes since the first iteration:\\n[bguiz/embeddable-widget-demo/compare/v0.0.1...v0.0.2](https://github.com/bguiz/embeddable-widget-demo/compare/v0.0.1...v0.0.2)\\n\\nRun `node index.js`, and click the buttons in each widget.\\nThe widget should update to contain a JSON string,\\nwhich is the response from the server.\\n\\n## Adding support for `iframe`s\\n\\nNot all widgets need to be added using `iframe`s,\\nas manipulating the DOM on the page on which the widget was embeed is often sufficient.\\nHowever, when security is a big concern,\\n`iframe`s are slightly better,\\nas you no longer need to enable CORS.\\n\\nNote however that it is not a silver bullet,\\nand that [neither are very secure](http://stackoverflow.com/a/25260056/194982).\\n\\n### Disable CORS\\n\\nFirstly, determine whether we wish to use `iframe`s -\\nlet us use them by default:\\n\\n    // index.js\\n    var defaults = {\\n        EMBED_TYPE: 'iframe',\\n        //...\\n    };\\n    //NOTE Set EMBED_TYPE to \\\"iframe\\\" or \\\"dom\\\"\\n    var useIframe = (process.env.EMBED_TYPE || defaults.EMBED_TYPE) === 'iframe';\\n\\nIn the same file, we enables CORS through our own middleware:\\n\\n    //enable CORS\\n    serverApp.use(function(req, res, next) { /* ... */ });\\n\\nChange this, such that the middleware only gets added when `useIframe` is true.\\n\\n    //enable CORS - only if not using iframes\\n    if (!useIframe) {\\n        serverApp.use(function(req, res, next) { /* ... */ });\\n    }\\n\\nWe also pass the `useIframe` flag into the `render` statement\\nwhen serving the platform script:\\n\\n    res.render('server'+platformScriptPath, {\\n        partyId: partyId,\\n        serverHost: serverHost,\\n        platformScript: platformScriptPath,\\n        inlineCss: data,\\n        useIframe: useIframe,\\n    });\\n\\n### Platform script inserts `iframe` instead\\n\\nCapture the `useIframe` variable in a template:\\n\\n    // views/server/3rd/foo/platform.js\\n    var useIframe = <%= useIframe %>;\\n\\nIn the `processFooWidget` function,\\nsplit the existing logic that deals with initialising the widget\\ninto a new function, called `createFooWidget`.\\n\\nIn this function, use templating to create two different render paths,\\ndepending on whether `useIframe` is true or false.\\n\\n    function createFooWidget(fooWidget, id) {\\n        <% if (useIframe) { %>\\n            /* ... */\\n        <% } else { %>\\n            var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\\n            /* (existing same-page DOM code) */\\n        <% } %>\\n    }\\n\\nIn the render path for when `useIframe` is true,\\nwe create the `iframe` as a DOM element,\\nand simply set its source to the widget HTML.\\n\\nWhen we do, the URL that the widget HTML is slightly modified,\\nto include an extra query parameter, `iframe=true`.\\n\\n    var iframe = document.createElement('iframe');\\n    iframe.setAttribute('src', serverHost+'/api/3rd/foo/widget/'+id+'/init?iframe=true&partyId='+partyId);\\n    iframe.setAttribute('class', 'foo-widget-iframe');\\n    iframe.setAttribute('data-foo-id', id);\\n    iframe.setAttribute('width', '200px');\\n    iframe.setAttribute('frameborder', '0');\\n    iframe.setAttribute('scrolling', 'no');\\n    iframe.style.border = 'none';\\n    iframe.style.height = '200px';\\n    iframe.style.width = '200px';\\n    iframe.style.position = 'relative';\\n    iframe.style.overflow = 'hidden';\\n    fooWidget.appendChild(iframe);\\n    fooWidget.setAttribute('data-foo-processed', 'done');\\n\\n### Move platform logic from platform to widget HTML\\n\\nIn the widget HTML, when `useIframe` is true,\\nwe now render a `script` tag.\\nThe contents of this `script` tag will be almost identical to the code within\\n`xhr.onload`:\\n\\n- Setting `data-foo-processed` has already been done by the platform script.\\n- Instead of setting `innerHTML`, we do not do anything - the `iframe` takes care of that for us!\\n- Instead of using `fooWidget`, we use the `iframe`'s content itself, which is referred to as `document`\\n\\n\\n\\n    // views/server/3rd/foo/widget-init.html\\n    <% if (isIframe) { %>\\n    <script>\\n        var serverHost = '<%= serverHost %>';\\n        var id = '<%= id %>';\\n        var partyId = '<%= partyId %>';\\n        var fooWidget = fooWidget;\\n        var fooWidgetButton = fooWidget.querySelector('.bar-button');\\n        /* (similar to the code within `xhr.onload`) */\\n    </script>\\n    <% } %>\\n\\nThe main intent here is to move this logic from the platform script,\\nwhich is run by the page that embeds the widget,\\nto this script within the widget HTML,\\nwhich is run by a page from your own platform server within an `iframe`.\\n\\nWe do this in order for the widget to invoke the platform APIs\\nwithout performing a cross-domain request.\\n\\n## Testing the `iframe` widgets\\n\\nA snapshot of the work so far:\\n[bguiz/embeddable-widget-demo/tree/v0.0.3](https://github.com/bguiz/embeddable-widget-demo/tree/v0.0.3)\\n\\n... or see the complete set of changes since the second iteration:\\n[bguiz/embeddable-widget-demo/compare/v0.0.2...v0.0.3](https://github.com/bguiz/embeddable-widget-demo/compare/v0.0.2...v0.0.3)\\n\\n- Run `node index.js`, and the widgets should load within an `iframe`.\\n- Run `EMBED_TYPE=dom node index.js`, and the widgets should load within the page DOM\\n\\nOf course, check that the server interactions continue to work,\\nin both the `iframe` version and the same-page DOM version.\\n\\nNote that in production, you most likely will not need to support both methods\\nsimultaneously, as we do here.\\nIf this is the case, then most of the conditional logic that we have here\\ncan be discarded, using just one or the other,\\nthereby reducing the load on the server when rendering these.\\n\\n## Some Pointers\\n\\n### Do not forget to document things for the 3rd parties\\n\\nThird parties want to be able to embed your widgets,\\nbut they need to know exactly how to do so.\\n\\nWhere possible make changes to the design of your widget to minimise\\nthe amount of effort required on behalf of the 3rd party.\\nIn this demo widget that we have built here,\\nI have tried to cut it down to the bare minimum:\\nthe 3rd party site needs to copy the script tag once per page,\\nand the each of the `div`s where they want them to appear.\\n\\n### Expect, and prepare, for 3rd parties to use widgets in unexpected ways\\n\\nOne common way this will manifest itself is if you have instructions to\\ncopy the script tag once per page only.\\nSome 3rd party sites will, inevitably, copy the script tag multiple times per page,\\nperhaps once per widget, because they misunderstood the instructions.\\n\\nPlan for robustness.\\nTry doing precisely this, and refresh your page,\\nand you should see the `skipping element` being output to screen.\\nBe sure to build in robustness like this into the scripts driving your widgets.\\n\\nThink of other situations in which the embed instructions could potentially be misused,\\nand plan contingency plans for each of them -\\nusually these would involve either ignoring or filtering.\\n\\nFor example, one more situation, which we have also taken into account in this demo widget,\\nis that 3rd party sites often are CMSes.\\nWhile some do allow Javascript,\\nmany CMSes do not, and only allow HTML.\\nFor this reason,\\nthe configuration for the script and widgets are stored entirely in HTML data attributes,\\ninstead of a config Javascript literal.\\n\\n## Source Code\\n\\nIf you would like to see the end result,\\nto see how it all fits together,\\nor just to give it a try,\\nyou can find the\\n[accompanying source code for this here](http://blog.bguiz.com/articles/embeddable-widgets-html-javascript/).\\n\\n## Work in progress\\n\\n- Page DOM vs. insert an `iframe`: [Question on Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/q/25236746/194982)\\n    - Include examples for both direct DOM manipulation and `iframe` methods\\n- One AJAX request per widget API is horribly wasteful, especially when you expect many of them to be on the same page. Consider coalescing the requests into one.\\n- The page and widget are pretty bare bones at the moment, make them look nicer by adding some styles\\n- Raw XHR - perhaps load jQuery or use some other library instead?\\n    - This will complicate the widget by needing to support loading dependencies without polluting the 3rd party site\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/articles/high-performance-networking-http1-http2\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"title\": \"High Performance Networking HTTP1 HTTP2\",\n          \"date\": 1407530820000,\n          \"comments\": true,\n          \"tags\": [\n            \"git\",\n            \"github\",\n            \"commandline\"\n          ],\n          \"source\": \"src/documents/articles/high-performance-networking-http1-http2.html.md\",\n          \"slug\": \"high-performance-networking-http1-http2\",\n          \"url\": \"/articles/high-performance-networking-http1-http2\",\n          \"urlAliases\": []\n        },\n        \"body\": \"\\n## [Chapter 11: HTTP/1](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch11.html)\\n\\nAll HTTP 1.0 should be upgraded to HTTP 1.1\\n\\nSummary of recommendations made in another book by Steve Souders:\\n\\n- Reduce DNS lookups\\n- Make fewer HTTP requests\\n- Use a Content Delivery Network\\n- Add an Expires header and configure ETags\\n- Gzip assets\\n- Avoid HTTP redirects\\n\\nMore concisely: \\\"eliminate and reduce unnecessary network latency, and minimize the amount of transferred bytes.\\\"\\n\\nMore things:\\n\\n- Add support for `keepalive`, and reduce the number of required HTTP handshakes\\n  between server and a single client\\n- Add support for HTTP pipelining so that requests are dispatched ASAP,\\n  and queueing happens on server instead\\n- Browser to use multiple TCP connections with the same server\\n- SHard resources across multiple hosts (or subdomains) for further increase parallelism\\n- Measure, and minimise size of HTTP headers\\n- Concatenation and spriting\\n- Resource inlining\\n\\n## [Chapter 12: HTTP/2](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch12.html)\\n\\nHTTP/1 does **not** modify the core semantics of HTTP/1 in any way:\\n\\n- still have the same verbs (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)\\n- still have headers\\n\\nAims to increase speed, and reduce latency, compared to HTTP/1:\\n\\n- Compress headers automatically\\n- New flow control, error handling, and upgrade mechanisms\\n- Allows multiple concurrent connections between the same client and server\\n- Able to specify request priorities at the protocol level\\n  - Take for example, gmail, which had to write this logic in client-side Javascript\\n- Binary message framing\\n- Longer lived connections, allowing better use of network capacity\\n\\n### Binary framing\\n\\n![Binary framing](http://orm-chimera-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1230000000545/images/hpbn_1201.png)\\n\\nWrap HTTP/1 text value in a binary frame,\\nand standardise format for all variables\\nsuch as white spaces and termination sequences\\nWhen the binary frame is unwrapped,\\nit may be treated identically to a HTTP/1 text value.\\n\\n### Streams, Messages, and Frames\\n\\n![](http://orm-chimera-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1230000000545/images/hpbn_1202.png)\\n\\nEach connection consists of multiple streams;\\neach stream consists of multiple frames;\\nmultiple frames make up a single request-response pair.\\n\\n??

packages.\\n\\nSince `ember-cli` install itself locally by default,\\nthe only global package you will need is `bower`.\\n\\n    npm install --save bower\\n\\n#### Except ember-cli\\n\\n... which must be in both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.\\n\\nThis is because the `ember` command inspects the `package.json`\\nin the file, looking for `ember-cli`.\\nIt does this to determine if that project is indeed an `ember-cli` app.\\nIf it does not find this there,\\nit will display an error saying that you need to run the command from within\\na folder containing an ember-cli app.\\n\\nIf this is too much trouble for what it is worth,\\nsimply issue this command instead:\\n\\n    heroku config:set NODE_ENV=staging\\n\\n... so that Heroku will run `npm install` instead of `npm install --production`\\nwhen it spins up the dyno.\\n\\n### Server on `web` Proc only\\n\\nThe process that runs the server *must* be called `web`.\\nDo not call it `main` or anything else.\\nIf you want to access a server running on a Heroku dyno from port `80` externally,\\nthat server *must* be running in a `Proc` named `web`.\\nI wish Heroku's documents actually stated this explicitly.\\n\\n    web: npm run start\\n\\n### Use `scripts` in `package.json`\\n\\nNodeJs packages may define an optional `scripts` section in their `package.json` file.\\nFor ember-cli apps, use `scripts.postinstall` to do a `bower` install;\\nand use `scripts.start` to start run `ember serve`\\n\\n#### Use the `PORT` environment variable\\n\\nWhen running ember serve, do not use a default port number.\\nWhenever heroku spins up a dyno (which happens at least once per deploy),\\nit will assign a new port number (among other things),\\nand this is the one that Heroku will port forward from port `80`.\\n\\n    \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n        \\\"start\\\": \\\"./node_modules/ember-cli/bin/ember serve --environment=production --port=${PORT}\\\",\\n        \\\"build\\\": \\\"./node_modules/ember-cli/bin/ember build\\\",\\n        \\\"test\\\": \\\"./node_modules/ember-cli/bin/ember test\\\",\\n        \\\"postinstall\\\": \\\"./node_modules/bower/bin/bower install\\\"\\n    },\\n\\nNote that `npm install` is not necessary in `scripts.postinstall` -\\nHeroku does that automatically for all NodeJs projects.\\n\\n## A Word of Caution\\n\\nYou should not use `ember serve` to deploy production apps.\\nThere are possibly some security and performance problems that this entails.\\nBut of course, sometimes you simply want to deploy a demo app,\\nand in these cases deploying and ember-cli app like this works quite well.\\n\\n## New to Heroku? - Quick Run-down\\n\\nHeroku is a cloud hosting service,\\nwhich allows you to spin up and down instances on the fly.\\nYou can operate it entirely via the command line by installing Heroku toolbelt,\\nand deployment happens by pushing to a git remote hosted on Heroku.\\n\\nIf deploying to Heroku for the first time,\\nyou will need to set up the requisites on your computer\\n\\n    wget -qO- https://toolbelt.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh\\n    # for other OS'es: https://toolbelt.heroku.com/\\n    ssh-keygen # save to id_rsa_heroku\\n    echo \\\"Host heroku.com\\\" >> ~/.ssh/config\\n\\techo \\\" IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_heroku\\\" >> ~/.ssh/config\\n\\tchmod 600 ~/.ssh/config\\n\\theroku keys:add\\n\\nTo get a NodeJs app up and running on Heroku,\\nfirst create the app, and when ready for deployment:\\n\\n    git init # if you have not done so already\\n    git add . && git commit -a # commit whatever should be deployed\\n    heroku create name-of-your-app\\n    git push heroku master\\n\\nHeroku's git repository has a post-hook that runs upon each push,\\nwhich will attempt to (re)install and (re)deploy your app,\\nand the push will only succeed if it the installation and deployment succeeds.\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/2014/07/10/migrating-from-tumblr-and-wordpress-to-docpad-extraction\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n

static site generation](http://blog.bguiz.com/2014/07/08/migrating-from-tumblr-and-wordpress-to-docpad-static-site-generation/).\\nLet us take a look at how to extract data from tumblr and wordpress blogs,\\nand transform it for [docpad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad),\\na static site generator.\\n\\n### Get Your Node On\\n\\n    mkdir blog-extract\\n    cd blog-extract\\n    npm init #accept all the defaults, it isnot very important\\n    npm install --save request mkdirp moment tumblr.js\\n    touch index.js\\n\\nEdit `index.js`, and add the following:\\n\\n    var fs = require('fs');\\n    var url = require('url');\\n    var path  = require('path');\\n    var mkdirp = require('mkdirp');\\n    var moment = require('moment');\\n    var request = require('request');\\n    var tumblr = require('tumblr.js');\\n\\nNow we have a shiny new NodeJs project ready to go,\\nwith batteries (dependencies) included.\\n\\n### Wordpress Posts API\\n\\nWordpress exposes a JSON API that allows you to extract your posts.\\nThere is almost no set up required, as no form or authentication is required.\\n\\nIn order to get our posts, we can follow\\n[these instructions](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/1/get/sites/%24site/posts/).\\n\\n#### Extract and transform\\n\\nWith the API documentation in hand, we can now write some code to automate that -\\nwe certainly do not want to be issuing multiple `wget` or `curl` calls,\\nand then copying the results from them into new files by hand .\\nI would do that for maybe a couple of posts,\\nbut since I am dealing with about 80 posts here,\\nand that is certainly going to be too time consuming of an endeavour!\\n\\n    var pos, step, total;\\n\\n    var wordpressSite = 'yourblogname.wordpress.com'; // replace with your own\\n    pos = 0;\\n    step = 20;\\n    total = 0;\\n    do {\\n        /*\\n         * Here we do the queries, and be sure to set total so that it loops more than once\\n         * The looping is necessary, because you cannot download all posts at once\\n         * and we must paginate the requests\\n         */\\n    } while (pos < total);\\n\\nThat is the basic run loop.\\nWithin the run loop, we perform the requests to the wordpress API server:\\n\\n        var reqUrl = 'https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/'+wordpressSite+'/posts/?number='+postsAtATime+'&offset='+postIdx;\\n        request(reqUrl, function(err, resp, body) {\\n            if (err || resp.statusCode !== 200) {\\n                console.log(err);\\n                return;\\n            }\\n            body = JSON.parse(body);\\n            if (body.total_posts > total) {\\n                //set total count, should only happen the first time\\n                total = body.total_posts;\\n            }\\n            //parse each of the posts in the response\\n            body.posts.forEach(function(post) {\\n                //transform the post into the format required by docpad\\n                //and write to file\\n            });\\n        });\\n\\nWe can take a look at what the API response for each blog post looks like in\\n[these instructions](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/1/get/sites/%24site/posts/).\\n\\nThe format that we need to translate to consists of two important parts:\\n\\n- Directory and file name\\n- Metadata\\n\\nThe third part is the post's contents,\\nbut that can be copied verbatim without any transformation.\\n\\nFor a default docpad blog configuration, this would usually be:\\n`src/documents/posts/slug-for-this-post.html`\\n\\nWe get check this by looking at `docpad.coffee`,\\nand inspecting `docpadConfig.collections.posts`:\\n\\n    `@getCollection('documents').findAllLive({relativeDirPath: 'posts'}, [date: -1])`\\n\\nWe are however, not going to put our extracted files in the `posts` folder,\\nand put them in a `wordpressposts` folder instead.\\nInstead we will create a separate folder for all the wordpress posts,\\nand configure docpad to look there as well.\\nThis configuration will be covered at the end,\\nso if you want to test things out right away,\\nskip to the bottom of the post\\n\\nI am using the plugin, `docpad-plugin-dateurls`,\\nso the URL paths of each of the posts is will match the default wordpress URL paths.\\nHere, we want the directory and file name to follow this pattern:\\n`src/documents/wordpressposts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug-for-post.html`\\n\\n            var postUrl = url.parse(post.URL);\\n            var pathname = postUrl.pathname;\\n            if (pathname.charAt(pathname.length - 1) === '/') {\\n                pathname = pathname.slice(0, -1);\\n            }\\n            pathname = pathname.slice(1).replace( /\\\\//g , '-');\\n            var filename = path.normalize('src/documents/wordpressposts/'+pathname+'.html');\\n\\nFor the metadata, we use moment to format the date and time\\n\\n            var title = post.title && post.title.replace(/\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\\\\\"');\\n            var date = moment(post.date).format('YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm');\\n            var tags = Object.keys(post.tags).join(', ');\\n            var contents = '---\\\\n'+\\n                'layout: post\\\\n'+\\n                'comments: true\\\\n'+\\n                'title: '+title+'\\\\n'+\\n                'date: '+date+'\\\\n'+\\n                'original-url: '+post.URL+'\\\\n'+\\n                'dateurls-override: '+postUrl.pathname+'\\\\n'+\\n                'tags: '+tags+'\\\\n'+\\n                '---\\\\n\\\\n'+post.content;\\n\\nFinally, write the output to file:\\n\\n            var dirname = path.dirname(filename);\\n            mkdirp(dirname);\\n            fs.writeFile(path.normalize(filename), contents, function(err) {\\n                if (err) {\\n                    console.log('Error', filename, err);\\n                    return;\\n                }\\n                console.log('Written', filename);\\n            });\\n\\n### Tumblr Posts API\\n\\nTumblr is a little more involved than Wordpress,\\nas in order to query any of their API,\\nyou will need to have a tumblr account\\n(which you probably already have since you are extracting your posts from it),\\nand [register a tumblr app](https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps)\\nto obtain an API keys.\\nCopy your \\\"OAuth Consumer Key\\\", and you are good to go.\\n\\nOnce that is done, we simply need to follow\\n[this section](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts)\\nin the documents.\\nThe upside ofthis slightly higher complexity is that tumblr provides\\na NodeJs client library that makes it easier to call the tumblr API,\\nand avoid having to deal with making raw HTTP requests,\\nlike we did for the Wordpress API.\\n\\n### Extract and transform\\n\\n    var tumblrSite = 'bguiz.tumblr.com'; // replace with your own\\n    var client = tumblr.createClient({\\n        consumer_key: 'sfsdfsdfsdfjkjksjdfhkjkjhkjshdfkjhkjhskdjfhkjhkjhd' //replace with your own\\n    });\\n    pos = 0;\\n    step = 20;\\n    total = 0;\\n    do {\\n        /*\\n         * Perform the paginated requests\\n         */\\n    } while (pos < total);\\n\\nPerforming the requests:\\n\\n        client.posts(tumblrSite, {\\n            offset: pos,\\n            limit: step,\\n        }, function(err, data) {\\n            if (err || ! data) {\\n                console.log(err, data);\\n                return;\\n            }\\n            if (data.total_posts > total) {\\n                //set total count, should only happen the first time\\n                total = data.total_posts;\\n            }\\n            data.posts.forEach(function(post) {\\n                //transform the post into the format required by docpad\\n                //and write to file\\n            });\\n        });\\n\\nHere, we want the directory and file name to follow this pattern:\\n`src/documents/tumblrposts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug-for-post.html`\\n\\n            var ts = moment(post.timestamp*1000);\\n            var postUrl = url.parse(post.post_url);\\n            var dateStr = ts.format('YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm');\\n            var filename = 'src/documents/tumblrposts/'+ts.format('YYYY-MM-DD')+\\n                '-'+postUrl.pathname.split('/').slice(-1)[0]+'.html';\\n\\nFor the metadata, we want to set the `dateurls-override` property.\\nNote that this feature is not yet available on in `docpad-plugin-dateurls`,\\nand you will need [my patch](https://github.com/mgroves84/docpad-plugin-dateurls/pull/12)\\nfor this to work.\\nTo get this, modify `package.json` in your root folder,\\nreplacing  the version number of the plugin with an explicit git URI, like so:\\n\\n    \\\"docpad-plugin-dateurls\\\": \\\"git+ssh://git@github.com:bguiz/docpad-plugin-dateurls.git#exclude-option\\\",\\n\\nThis tells npm to install a NodeJs package, not from the default npm repository,\\nbut instead by cloning a git repository.\\nUnfortunately, this also means docpad will not be able to run the plugin yet,\\nas [`npm install`ing a git url does not run `prepublish`](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3055).\\nTo work around this, for now, you need to do the following:\\n\\n    npm install\\n    docpad run # fails \\\"Error: Cannot find module 'node_modules/docpad-plugin-dateurls/out/dateurls.plugin.js'\\\"\\n    cd node_modules/docpad-plugin-dateurls\\n    cake compile && cake install\\n    ls out #you should see dateurls.plugin.js\\n    cd ../..\\n    docpad run # success!\\n\\nFor tumblr posts, the default URL path follows the format\\n`/post/12345678/slug-for-this-post`,\\nand if we migrate posts from the old blog to the new blog,\\nany links, especially external ones, to the site will be broken.\\nThat will make for a really annoying experience for those visiting your sites,\\nso it is best to preserve URLs where possible;\\nhence the need to override the default URLs.\\n\\n            var title = post.title && post.title.replace(/\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\\\\\"');\\n            var tags = post.tags.join(', ');\\n            var contents = '---\\\\n'+\\n                'layout: post\\\\n'+\\n                'comments: true\\\\n'+\\n                'title: '+title+'\\\\n'+\\n                'date: '+dateStr+'\\\\n'+\\n                'original-url: '+post.post_url+'\\\\n'+\\n                'dateurls-override: '+postUrl.pathname+'\\\\n'+\\n                'tags: '+tags+'\\\\n'+\\n                '---\\\\n\\\\n'+post.body;\\n\\nFinally, write the output to file:\\n\\n            var dirname = path.dirname(filename);\\n            mkdirp(dirname);\\n            fs.writeFile(path.normalize(filename), contents, function(err) {\\n                if (err) {\\n                    console.log('Error', filename, err);\\n                    return;\\n                }\\n                console.log('Written', filename);\\n            });\\n\\n### Docpad Configuration Changes\\n\\nWe edit `docpad.coffee`, in the root directory of the docpad project.\\nModify `docpadConfig.collections.posts` to look like this instead.\\n\\n    @getCollection('documents').findAllLive({relativeDirPath: {'$in' : ['docpadposts', 'tumblrposts', 'wordpressposts']}}, [date: -1])\\n\\nAll the wordpress posts should be in `src/documents/wordpressposts`,\\ntumblr posts in `src/documents/tumblrposts`.\\nWhen writing any new docpad posts save them in `src/documents/docpadposts`.\\n\\nIf you have any `docpadConfig.environments` configured,\\nbe sure to modify each of their `collections.posts` accordingly too.\\n\\nThat is all there is to do for now.\\nExecute `docpad run`, and visit the newly extracted blog in a browser!\\n\\n### Where to from here?\\n\\nOne task in blog extraction, that we have not covered here, is that of any\\nstatic assets, such as images, that may have been hosted on your previous blogs.\\nMost notably, images.\\nIf you have hosted these on CDNs, they will continue to work.\\nOtherwise, you will need to extract them too.\\n\\nAnother extraction task that we have not covered are links between posts.\\nSince we have preserved the path for each post's URL here,\\nthis should not pose a problem.\\n\\nThe solution to both of these involves parsing the URLs in each post's content,\\nbe it `href` attributes in `<a>` tags,\\nor `src` attributes in `<img>` tags,\\nand download and save them too.\\n\"\n      },\n

[tumblr](http://tumblr.com),\\nand previously I blogged using [wordpress](http://wordpress.org).\\nWhile both of these are great platforms,\\nthey share common pitfalls, when it comes to giving you control over your writing.\\n\\nI wanted to be able to have a copy of all the assets that comprise my blog,\\nin its entirety, on my hard disk, and be able to modify and publish them as I pleased.\\nI also wanted to be able to include fancier things in my pages -\\nlike embed a Github gist, or create my own d3 visualisation,\\nor, well why not take it to an extreme,\\ncreate an AngularJs app running within one of my posts;\\nand I wanted to be able to do all of these things without having to log into\\nsome website hosted in a far away country,\\nand wait for all those bytes to fly across several oceans and back each time.\\n\\nFlexibility and control - that is key.\\n\\n### Enter Static Site Generators\\n\\nFor a blog, the contents are almost static.\\nThe server only needs to send a different response for a page,\\nwhen that page has been modified by the author.\\nThe exception to this are comments,\\nbut with the advent of [disqus](http://disqus.com),\\nthat is no longer even a consideration.\\n\\nA content management system, including both tumblr and wordpress,\\nbuilds each page upon demand, which can be an expensive operation,\\nas it involves database queries, assemlby of templates, et cetera.\\nQuite often, when a CMS driven site receives a lot of concurrent visitors,\\nits response times start to lag noticeably.\\nTo work around this, it has become common practice to cache the results of\\neach dynamically generated page, using tools like\\n[memcached](http://memcached.org/).\\n\\nStatic site generation is all about taking caching to the next level.\\nThe author of the site knows exactly when the previous cache needs to be invalidated -\\nwhen they write a new post or update an existing one.\\nWhy not, at that point of time, generate the cache contents,\\nand upload them directly to the server?\\nWell, that is exactly what static site generators do;\\nthe static files are the cache\\n\\n### What about collaboration?\\n\\nOne of the big advantages of a CMS is that it enables collaboration.\\nIf everyone just logs into the same website,\\nbe it `wordpress.org` or `tumblr.com`,\\nand made their edits on the site,\\nthen there is only one copy of the site,\\nand therefore it is easy to manage collaboration on the contents of the site.\\n\\nIndeed that is a very direct and simple solution that addresses collaboration.\\nWe do, however, have a more sophisticated solution,\\nthat is already readily available:\\n[distributed version control systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control).\\nTools such as [git](http://git-scm.com/) and\\n[mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/)\\nhave solved the distributed collaboration problem in a rather elegant way.\\nAll collaborators get to keep a copy of the site that they are contributing to\\non their own computers, and thus get the benefits that come along with that.\\nWhen they are done writing a post,\\nthey simply have to *push* their latest contributions to the *master* copy.\\nThere are built in mechanisms to resolve any conflicts,\\nfor example, if two collaborators edit the same file.\\n\\n### Docpad\\n\\nAfter reviewing the top few [in this humungous list](http://staticsitegenerators.net/),\\nI have decided that [Docpad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)\\nsuits my needs the best, and I should be able to hit the ground running.\\nI will give it a go, and the best part is, if I do not like it,\\nmy data is not stuck on some server somewhere -\\nit will all be on my computer,\\nand easily moved to a different static site generator.\\n\\nIn the next post, I will be tackling that very problem:\\nWith hosted CMSs, like tumblr and wordpress,\\ngetting your data out can be a little tricky;\\nas can be transforming it such that it can be used in a static site generator.\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/2014/07/03/file-download-with-http-request-header\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n

typically stored inside cookies,\\nand the browser automatically adds the cookies to every HTTP request&#8217;s headers\\nfor that domain.</p>\\n\\n<p>When you create an anchor tag, and set its URL to

the cookie\\nthat gets automatically added to the HTTP request header by the the browser.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, it is not quite so simple if the website uses token-based authentication.\\nThis is

and initiate an AJAX request,\\nbeing sure to add the appropriate token in the request header:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>    var id = 123;\\n    var req = ic.ajax.raw({\\n        type: 'GET',\\n        url:

encoding or temporary files.</p>\\n\\n<p>Using HTML5 temporary files:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>            var maxSizeForBase64 = 1048576; //1024 * 1024\\n            var windowUrl = window.URL ||

base64 encoding when less than set limit or file API is not available\\n                anchor.attr({\\n                    href:

}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>In both cases we set the anchor tag to a data URI or file URI,\\nand then trigger a click event on it.</p>\\n\\n<p>The caveat for this however, is that both of these approaches are going to be\\nrather inefficient when downloading and processing large files.\\nMore so for the base64 encoding method than the HTML5 File API method.</p>\\n\\n<p>One way of solving this problem is to modify the server such that the route that\\nrequires the token in the HTTP header does not respond with file contents,\\nbut instead with the URL of a another route,\\nwhich <em>does not</em> require anything in the header at all, \\nbut expires very quickly.\\nIt is this route which actually returns the file contents.</p>\\n\\n<p>In my case however, I only needed to download rather small files\\n(mostly under 1KB), so this worked very well,\\nas I wanted to find if there was a way to solve this problem client-side.\\nWith large files however, I would recommend

href=\\\"https://github.com/bguiz/broccoli-sprite\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">broccoli-sprite</a>.\\nI was just a week into using BroccoliJs for the first time,\\nand writing a plugin for a build system that I had barely used\\nwas understandably tricky.</p>\\n\\n<p>While writing it, I googled quite a bit for how to write a BroccoliJs plugin,\\nbut there really has not been much written about it.\\nI would like to make it easier for others doing the same thing,\\nso here is a quick overview of the process of creating a BroccoliJs plugin.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Basics</h2>\\n\\n<p>What is <a href=\\\"https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">BroccoliJs</a>?\\nThink [GruntJs], but different.\\nDifferent how?\\nWell in a number of ways. Its creator, Jo Liss,\\n[explains its philosophy in her post on its release].</p>\\n\\n<p>tl;dr= Plugins can chain their output to one another,\\nand the built-in watch only rebuilds what has changed rather than the whole lot.</p>\\n\\n<p>There is one more thing to it:\\nIf you are building an app using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ember-cli</a>,\\nyou will <em>need</em> to use BroccoliJs.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Sold! Now Time to Write a BroccoliJs Plugin</h2>\\n\\n<p>The first thing to take a look at is the\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli#plugin-api-specification\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">plugin API specification</a>.\\nLooks very straight forward:\\nThere are just two things that you need to implement:\\n<code>tree.read()</code>and <code>tree.cleanup()</code>.\\nThe former, however, does not really do much that is useful, on its own at least.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\\n\\n<p>All BroccoliJs plugins are NodeJs modules that should be installed\\ninside a project</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>cd my-project/\\nnpm install --save-dev broccoli-my-plugin\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>… and thus the first step is to create an <code>npm</code> package:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>mkdir broccoli-my-plugin #replace `my-plugin` with the name you would like\\ncd broccoli-my-plugin/\\n#if you plan to use version control (which is a good idea), do it now, e.g.\\n#git init &amp;&amp; git flow init\\nnpm init #this creates `package.json`\\n#be sure to specifiy one of the keywords as `broccoli-plugin`\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Now you will need to edit <code>index.js</code>, which exports your plugin:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>var BroccoliMyPlugin = function BroccoliMyPlugin() {};\\nmodules.exports = BroccoliMyPlugin;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<h3>Extending an Existing BroccoliJs Plugin</h3>\\n\\n<p>BroccoliJs has several plugins, that are designed to be extended.\\nThe one that we will look at here is\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli-writer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">broccoli-writer</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Install it:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>npm install broccoli-writer\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Edit <code>index.js</code>:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>var brocWriter = require('broccoli-writer');\\n\\nvar BroccoliMyPlugin = function BroccoliMyPlugin() {\\n  if (!(this instanceof BroccoliMyPlugin)) {\\n    return new BroccoliMyPlugin();\\n  }\\n};\\nBroccoliMyPlugin.prototype = Object.create(brocWriter.prototype);\\nBroccoliMyPlugin.prototype.constructor = BroccoliMyPlugin;\\nBroccoliMyPlugin.prototype.description = 'my-plugin';\\nmodules.exports = BroccoliMyPlugin;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Here we have simply extended the function exported by broccoli-writer\\nusing prototypical inheritance.\\nAt the moment it does not do anything at all,\\nand we will add that next.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Adding functionality</h3>\\n\\n<p>Firstly, we should make the plugin able to accept some input parameters.\\nAll BroccoliJs plugins <em>must</em> accept an input tree as its first argument.\\nAny subsequent parameters are completely up to you as the plugin developer.\\nA common pattern, however, seems to be to accept just one parameter,\\nand <code>options</code> hash, which is what we will do here.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>var brocWriter = require('broccoli-writer');\\n\\nvar BroccoliMyPlugin = function BroccoliMyPlugin(inTree, options) {\\n  if (!(this instanceof BroccoliMyPlugin)) {\\n    return new BroccoliMyPlugin(inTree, options);\\n  }\\n  this.inTree = inTree;\\n  this.options = options || {};\\n};\\nBroccoliMyPlugin.prototype = Object.create(brocWriter.prototype);\\nBroccoliMyPlugin.prototype.constructor = BroccoliMyPlugin;\\nBroccoliMyPlugin.prototype.description = 'my-plugin';\\nmodules.exports = BroccoliMyPlugin;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>We add the <code>inTree</code> and <code>options</code> parameters to the constructor function,\\nand then save them in the instance.\\nIf you wish to specify default options,\\nor other instance variables,\\nthis is where you would parse and set them.</p>\\n\\n<p>Next we can implement the main functionality,\\nthe part where we specify the thing that this plugin does.\\nSince this plugins extends the <code>broccoli-writer</code> plugin,\\nwe do this by specifying a <code>write</code>function:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>BroccoliMyPlugin.prototype.write = function(readTree, destDir) {\\n  var self = this;\\n  return readTree(this.inTree).then(function (srcDir) {\\n    /* use srcDir and information from self.options to figure out which files to read from */\\n    /* use destDir and information from self.options to figure outwhich files to write to */\\n    /* synchronously read input files, do some processing, and write output files */\\n  });\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p><code>readTree</code> is passed in as the first variable to the <code>write function,\\nand this is a function that returns a promise that you should return.\\nCall</code>then()`on the promise, and do the processing in the callback function.\\nHere you do whatever it is the plugin needs to do;\\nbut you have to do it synchronously - no callbacks allowed.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Asynchronous Plugins</h3>\\n\\n<p>Most of the time however, we want to do things asynchronously -\\nafter all, that is the NodeJs way!\\nSee Mixu&#8217;s article on <a href=\\\"http://book.mixu.net/node/ch7.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">control flow in NodeJs</a>\\nfor an excellent introduction to asynchronous code in NodeJs.\\nWe need to get a little more advance than this however,\\nand use promises instead of callbacks.\\nNot to worry though, promises are actually much more straight forward to use\\nthan callbacks!\\nIn fact, we have already used the one returned by the <code>readTree</code> function previously.</p>\\n\\n<p>We shall use promises implemented in the RSVP library,\\nas that appears to be the most popular choice amongst Broccoli plugins;\\nalthough you are free to use any other promise library.</p>\\n\\n<p>Install RSVP:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>npm install --save rsvp\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Include RSVP:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>var rsvp= require('rsvp');\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Modify the <code>readTree</code> callback to create a promise an return it.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>return readTree(this.inTree).then(function (srcDir) {\\n  /* use srcDir and information from self.options to figure out which files to read from */\\n  /* use destDir and information from self.options to figure outwhich files to write to */\\n  var promise = new rsvp.Promise(function(resolvePromise, rejectPromise) {\\n    /* asynchronously read input files, do some processing, and write output files,\\n       for example, here we have `someAsyncFunc` that does this` */\\n    someAsyncFunc(function(err, asyncData) {\\n      if (err) {\\n        rejectPromise(err);\\n      }\\n      else {\\n        resolvePromise(asyncData);\\n      }\\n    });\\n  });\\n  return promise;\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Here, since we return a promise, BroccoliJs knows to wait until it is\\neither resolved or rejected.\\nFor the more astute, you will notice that here we actually have\\na promise within a promise, as <code>readTree</code> itself returns a promise.\\nWe could possibly refactor this to chain the promises instead of nesting them,\\nbut I shall leave that as an exercise for the reader!</p>\\n\\n<h2>Fin</h2>\\n\\n<p>Now we have a functional BroccoliJs plugin, and it is ready to be published:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>npm publish\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>… and now anyone can <code>npm install</code> it!</p>\\n\\n<h2>Going further</h2>\\n\\n<p>Besides <a href=\\\"https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli-writer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">broccoli-writer</a>,\\nthere is also <a href=\\\"https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli-filter\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">broccoli-filter</a>,\\nand <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rjackson/broccoli-caching-writer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">broccoli-caching-writer</a>, \\nwhich I have not covered here.</p>\\n\\n<p>Depending on what your plugin does, you might want to extend these instead.\\nOne great way to learn more about writing BroccoliJs plugins is to\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.org/search?q=broccoli-plugin\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">search for existing ones</a>,\\nand examine the source code for each one.\\nMost of them are fairly simple, only containing a single <code>index.js</code> file,\\nwhich means that you will likely find what you are looking for rather quickly.\\nIn fact, that is precisely what I did to get up to speed,\\nwhen writing <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bguiz/broccoli-sprite\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">brocoli-sprite</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p><a

a couple of days before my presentation - while running through the presentation in my head.\\nIt was pretty much a picture postcard view every couple of minutes along the coastline.\\nAt some point in this rather nice walk, inspiration struck on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bguiz/qryq\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">qryq</a>.\\nThat culminated <a href=\\\"https://gist.github/com/bguiz/7068093\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">in these code snippets</a>, and was the basis for re-jigging about half my presentation.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Web Directions South 2013</h3>\\n\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://webdirections.org/wds13/images/5d86c652.web_directions_13_logo.png\\\" alt=\\\"Web Directions South 2013\\\"/></p>\\n\\n<p>It was a great experience attending what felt like the biggest tech conference in Australia.\\nIt was also great to see a few familiar faces presenting: <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/markdalgleish\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Mark Dalgleish</a>, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ryanseddon\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Ryan Seddon</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/glenmaddern\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Glen Maddern</a>.\\nThe talks here were grouped into two streams, code and design - which made it easier to select which ones to attend.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Attending next year?</h3>\\n\\n<p>OSDC focussed a lot more on programming; and its scope was very broad, covering many different technologies, and languages.\\nWeb Directions South focussed a lot more on design; and its scope was more specific, covering only technologies in the web stack.\\nWorth mentioning that Web Directions has a sister conference, Web Directions Code which is more focussed on programming, but still focussed on technologies on the web stack.</p>\\n\\n<h2>On attending conferences</h2>\\n\\n<p>This being the first time I have attended large tech conferences, I have learnt much not just about the subject matter of the talks given, but also much about the other aspects of them.\\nWhen attending them, one wears different hats - traveller, attendee, and speaker - and here are a few things I took away about maximising the time spent at them.</p>\\n\\n<h3>As a traveller</h3>\\n\\n<p>Travelling to a conference is not a lot different to travelling for other reasons.\\nThe main thing to remember is that being on conference is like going to work, and thus not very relaxing.\\nPro-tip: Do not book a hectic flight schedule!</p>\\n\\n<h3>As an attendee</h3>\\n\\n<p>Attending a conference is mostly about sitting down and listening to someone speak.\\nMaking the most of this experience is a balancing act.\\nListen to the speaker; watch the screen projection; take notes; follow the twitter feed; reflecting about how what you have just taken in can be applied to your own work.\\nJuggling all of that can be tricky.</p>\\n\\n<p>I found that the easiest thing to do is to leave out the twitter feed, except for right at the beginning, and right at the end of the talk.\\nSave reflections and developing ideas for application till after the talk, and just jot the ideas down quickly when you have them.\\nMost importantly, take notes; and when doing so, avoid writing down anything that is on the slides, and instead what the speaker is saying, as usually you can find the slides afterwards anyway.</p>\\n\\n<p>One thing about conferences is that they often run multiple concurrent tracks.\\nOSDC had three, and WDS had two.\\nWhile it is great that you get to pick your favourite ones to attend, sometimes there are two that you would like to attend that happen to run at the same time, and a tough choice needs to be made.\\nWhat I learnt here was that it pays to do your homework - research the topic presented, and what the presenter has written about it prior.</p>\\n\\n<p>While attending the presentations are what you will spend most of your time doing, it is important not to neglect the other parts.\\nIn between the presentations, there will be time to mingle, and that should be used well.\\nSpend it talking to the presenters and the other attendees; usually they are looking to do the same themselves!</p>\\n\\n<p>Oh yes.\\nMake sure to remember to bring an extra long power cord!</p>\\n\\n<h3>As a speaker</h3>\\n\\n<p>Speaking is hard, mostly because of the need to prepare.\\nOnce at the conference, prepare to completely rework your slide deck, because new ideas will occur;\\nas will last minute feel-the-need-for-improvement frenzies.\\nIn fact, I redid half of my presentation the day before I spoke.</p>\\n\\n<p>On my first day in Auckland, I was a little lost walking around the city, and asked for directions from a stranger, who was happy to walk with me as he was going in the same general direction.\\nTurned out he was a budding web developer, and I told him about OSDC - he had not heard of it - and he bought a single day ticket, and came to see my talk.</p>\\n\\n<p>Something that I thought I did quite well (if I do not say so myself) was to use the breaks in between presentations, and other opportunities, to talk to other attendees, and mention what I was going to talk about to the other attendees and speakers.\\nThat gathered quite a bit of interest, and resulted in a full house during my talk, and even had some expressions of interest in using and porting <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bguiz/qryq\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">qryq</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another thing, which I have learnt from one of the other speakers was to bring marketing materials.\\nHe handed out one page print-outs of the software he was speaking about.\\nI thought that that was a brilliant idea - so much better than just a name card - keep that in mind for the next time.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Watch this space</h2>\\n\\n<p>More to come on OSDC2013 and WDS2013 soon.</p>\"\n      },\n      \"/2013/10/22/backbonejs-grouped-collection-techniques-four\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"comments\": true,\n          \"title\": \"BackboneJs Grouped Collection Techniques -

Sure, you write tests when doing BDD, but then again you do so when doing conventional development as well. (If you are not, consider it!)</p>\\n\\n<p>The difference is not about whether you write tests, but rather <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> you write them, within the software development process.</p>\\n\\n<p>In BDD, you are simply writing the specifications for your software in the form of tests. You specify that my program should do <strong>X</strong>, without having written <strong>X</strong> at all. You write a test case to test for this, run it, and obviously it will fail, as you have yet to write <strong>X</strong>.</p>\\n\\n<p>If writing in a compiled language, you would have had to write out stubs for <strong>X</strong>; if you are writing in an interpreted languages, this is not enforced, but you may do so anyway. Thus by writing your specifications in code, you have begun to think about them programmatically; the API of the program, modules/ packages, and classes would have begun to formulate.</p>\\n\\n<p>After writing the specification in the format of the test, we then attempt to implement that particular specification, in order to make the test pass. We then refactor the code, to make the code cleaner, make the API more idiomatic, etc., or any improvement to it, so long as we do not break the test that we have just got to pass.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Mocking</h3>\\n\\n<p>Sometimes when writing a test for behaviour <strong>X</strong>, we realise that it would rely on another behaviour <strong>Y</strong> in order to work. Turns out that <strong>Y</strong> is complex enough to warrant a BDD cycle of its own. Mocking is useful in this sort of situation.</p>\\n\\n<p>Without mocking, one would comment out the test for behaviour <strong>X</strong>, or annotate it with <code>@Ignore</code> (or equivalent), so that this is no longer tested; before proceeding to write the test for behaviour <strong>Y</strong>, implement behaviour <strong>Y</strong>, and perform a refactor. Only once all this is done, can we continue work on behaviour <strong>X</strong> again.</p>\\n\\n<p>Using mocking, we use a library that integrates with the language or test framework. This library provides us with several functions that can be used to quickly mock up an object or function for immediate use. This allows us to skip having to test or implement behaviour <strong>Y</strong> before continuing with behaviour <strong>X</strong>.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Phases of BDD</h3>\\n\\n<p>BDD is done in cycles, where each cycle has a number of phases. One cycle is done per behaviour that we wish to define.</p>\\n\\n<p>The phases are:</p>\\n\\n<ul><li>Write the test: should&#8230; when&#8230; given&#8230;</li>\\n<li>Implement the behaviour</li>\\n<li>Refactor the code</li>\\n</ul><p>Take note of when the tests are written in each cycle: <strong>First</strong>. The tests specify behaviours that have not yet been implemented. It is only subsequently that this is done. This is important because it signifies a different mindset in the approach toward writing software, when compared to the conventional manner.</p>\\n\\n<p>When writing the tests, write them like you would specify user stories. Given-When-Then (GWT) is one way to approach this, and is appropriate for the majority of them.</p>\\n\\n<p>Implementing the behaviour is the same as it is with conventional software development methodologies, with one key exception: You will likely already have created stubs for the objects and functions, by the time you get to this stage.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is one of the <em>key differences</em> between BDD and conventional development - that we would have already reasoned about the structure and interface of the code before actually writing any of it. Worth noting also is that we would be wearing our testing hat while reasoning about this.</p>\\n\\n<p>(Refactoring: Self-explanatory)</p>\\n\\n<h3>TDD vs BDD</h3>\\n\\n<p>Test-driven development and behaviour-driven development are very similar. Superficially, it seems like we have simply replaced the word &#8220;test&#8221; with &#8220;behaviour&#8221;. However, there are a few key differences around:</p>\\n\\n<ul><li>Language: What words should be used, how descriptive names should be</li>\\n<li>Focus on end-user expectations: &#8220;As a [X], I want [Y], so that [Z]&#8221;</li>\\n</ul><p>Dan North <a href=\\\"http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">explains BDD in more detail</a>, and highlights more differences. In the bigger picture however, they both share the same fundamental philosophy, and that is the approach of treating tests as specifications first and foremost, as therefore writing tests prior to implementation.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Tools Used</h2>\\n\\n<p>The tools we would use for BDD are largely the same tools we would use for unit testing. All we need in order to get up and running with BDD is the ability to execute unit tests on your project. From then on, the difference lies not in the tool chain, but rather in the approach, which we have covered above.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are indeed some optional tools that we can use to aid or enhance the process and experience of behaviour-driven development. We can swap the regular unit testing framework out for another which provides BDD syntax or makes it easier to write BDD tests. We can also add a mocking library to mock behaviours that have yet to be implemented. For example, if developing a Javascript app, instead of using <a href=\\\"http://qunitjs.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">QUnit</a>, use <a href=\\\"http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Jasmine</a> as the testing framework; and use <a href=\\\"http://sinonjs.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">SinonJS</a> for mocking.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Credit</h2>\\n\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/wakaleo\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">John Smart</a> conducted a short session on TDD/ BDD, and has inspired this post.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n<p>When writing software the conventional way, I implement the required functionality, and then write the tests for them afterward. While writing these tests, I sometimes &#8220;overshoot&#8221; by writing some extra tests for new functionality, because writing the original tests happens to makes me think more about the functionality while I have my testing hat on: What if this happens, and what if that happens? Sometimes these tests work right away, and at other times they do not, and I go back to fix or implement them.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now I realise that I have been doing BDD or TDD, in short bursts here and there, on many occasions myself, without realising it at the time. Surprising, considering is quite a different approach toward software development; and now I think, one worth exploring proper.</p>\\n\\n<p>IMHO, the <em>key advantage</em> is that with the BDD approach, we reason about the structure and interface of the code we write <em>while we have our testing hats on</em> - and this could be what is needed to write code that is more robust and less error-prone.</p>\"\n      },\n      \"/2013/09/06/digest-cycles-in-single-page-apps\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"comments\": true,\n          \"title\": \"Digest Cycles in Single Page Apps\",\n          \"date\": 1378458120000,\n          \"original-url\": \"http://blog.bguiz.com/post/60397801810/digest-cycles-in-single-page-apps\",\n          \"dateurls-override\": \"/post/60397801810/digest-cycles-in-single-page-apps\",\n          \"tags\": [\n            \"javascript\",\n            \"game loop\",\n            \"digest cycle\",\n            \"dirty checking\",\n            \"emberjs\",\n            \"angularjs\",\n            \"backbonejs\",\n            \"single page app\",\n            \"optimisation\",\n            \"blog\"\n          ],\n          \"source\": \"src/documents/tumblrposts/2013-09-06-digest-cycles-in-single-page-apps.html\",\n          \"url\": \"/2013/09/06/digest-cycles-in-single-page-apps\",\n          \"urlAliases\": [\n            \"/post/60397801810/digest-cycles-in-single-page-apps\"\n          ]\n        },\n        \"body\": \"\\n<p>We will be taking a very concise look into digest cycles, and their use in Javascript single page applications.</p>\\n\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"http://bguiz.github.io/preso-digest-cycles/\\\" title=\\\"Digest Cycles in Single Page Apps\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Accompanying Slides</a></em></p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://docs.angularjs.org/img/guide/concepts-runtime.png\\\" alt=\\\"AngularJS digest cycle diagram\\\"/></p>\\n\\n<p>This is a diagram from the official AngularJS documentation that explains what a digest cycle is. If this goes over the top of your head, don&#8217;t worry, it did for me too. It is more complicated than it needs to be.</p>\\n\\n<p>A digest cycle is, simply put, code that runs at an interval. This interval may be sometimes simply as fast as possible after the previous one, and sometimes the interval is set.</p>\\n\\n<p>They are typically used to aggregate expensive tasks such that they do not have to run multiple times when there is no need to do so. For example, DOM rendering.</p>\\n\\n<p>While we are here to talk about digest cycles in the context of Javascript SPAs, a discussion of this will not be complete without talking about where the idea for this originated from.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Game Loop is a term familiar to most games developers. When writing a game, one would typically set the interval of the game loop, such that each cycle runs as soon as possible after the previous one completes. As such a variable frame rate is inevitable, and techniques such as linear interpolation of time elapsed is used to calculate the rendered position of a moving object, for example.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>An <a href=\\\"http://www.koonsolo.com/news/dewitters-gameloop/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">introduction</a>, and an <a href=\\\"http://www.gameprogblog.com/generic-game-loop/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">in-depth explanation</a>.</em></p>\\n\\n<p>In single page apps, digest cycles are also used. Their intent here is quite different, because maxing out frames per second is not usually a goal for web apps. When using dirty checking to observe for model state changes, SPAs have taken two different approaches - <a href=\\\"http://bguiz.com/post/57373805814/accessors-vs-dirty-checking-in-javascript-frameworks\\\" title=\\\"Accessors vs. Dirty-checking\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">dirty checking and accessors</a>, which you can read about on my blog. In fact this presentation is a derivative work of that post.</p>\\n\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/v1.0.x/src/ng/rootScope.js#L364\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">AngularJS&#8217; $digest</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/1-0-beta/packages/ember-metal/lib/run_loop.js#L216\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">EmberJS&#8217; Ember.run+runLoop</a></em></p>\\n\\n<p>When using dirty checking, as AngularJS does, a digest cycle is necessary. When using the alternative to dirty checking - accessors - as BackboneJS and EmberJS do, a digest cycle is <em>not necessary</em>. In fact, BackboneJS does not have one, but EmberJS does.</p>\\n\\n<p>So why are digest cycles important in SPA frameworks? As mentioned earlier, it is where you would put your code that dirty checks your models for differences to previous state. Secondly - and this is why EmberJS uses it despite using accessors - is that it improves efficiency.</p>\\n\\n<p>Each change on each model sets off a DOM update, and thus a re-render, and a reflow. The latter two are expensive operations. Instead of doing this once per model change, we instead aggregate the changes until the point where the digest cycle executes - updating a purely in-memory buffer with the new DOM with all the changes. When the it is time for the digest cycle to execute, this buffer replaces the relevant parts of the DOM; which then re-renders and reflows just once per digest cycle.</p>\\n\\n<p>Changes listeners that are triggered are aggregated in a similar manner, and all of them are fired at once during the digest cycle.</p>\\n\\n<p><code></code></p>\\n\\n<pre>\\nApp.Person = Ember.Object.extend({\\n    bmi: function() {\\n        var height = this.get('height');\\n        return this.get('weight') / height / height;\\n    }.property('weight', 'height')\\n});\\n</pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here is an example of a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/1-0-beta/packages/ember-runtime/lib/ext/function.js#L64\\\" title=\\\"Computed properties allow you to treat a function like a property\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">computed property</a> in an EmberJS app. What this says is &#8220;whenever the <code>weight</code> or <code>height</code> properties of a <code>Person</code> model change, its <code>bmi</code> property could change too.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n<p>Computed properties rely on the framework maintaining a directed acyclic graph (per model class) between properties, and needs to traverse them (per model instance). These traversals can be expensive, so we defer them to - you guessed it - the digest cycle.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now that we know more about digest cycles - what is the main takeaway from it? The number one thing to avoid, is doing too much in each digest cycle.

However, one area - managing model state - is not as simple to do. Here we shall take a look at the decisions involved in managing long-lived model state; that is, ways to maintain model state when navigating between pages, and keeping them in sync with changes on the server.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Impact on Models</h2>\\n\\n<p>Most SPA frameworks are MV∗ frameworks. I have previously mentioned them in my post on <a href=\\\"http://bguiz.com/post/57373805814/accessors-vs-dirty-checking-in-javascript-frameworks\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Accessors vs Dirty Checking in Javascript Frameworks</a> (check out that section if you have yet to).</p>\\n\\n<p>One thing that all MV∗ SPA frameworks have in common is that they all need use Models to represent data. Managing the state of these models is one of the problems which MV∗ SPA frameworks have to solve. Implementations of how this is done vary significantly, and they all generally do a good job of it. One area, however, that I have found lacking amongst them, in managing model state, is that they generally do not provide a mechanism to manage long-lived model state baked into the framework - and one needs to roll their own mechanism to accomplish this.</p>\\n\\n<p>This post will explore this in greater depth; including some strategies used to keep model state on the client in sync with the data backing that model on the server; and also discuss the additional considerations that arise from maintaining this state across page navigation.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Two Decisions</h2>\\n\\n<p>When are models fetched?</p>\\n\\n<ul><li>fetch model once per navigation</li>\\n<li>fetch model on first navigation only</li>\\n</ul><p>When are subscription to changes on models reset?</p>\\n\\n<ul><li>subscriptions reset per navigation</li>\\n<li>subscriptions on first navigation only</li>\\n</ul><p>Ultimately these decisions should be made upon expectations that users have towards the user interface, and user expectations of how it should behave. These expectations have changed somewhat in the domain of web applications.</p>\\n\\n<h3>The lead up to present day SPAs</h3>\\n\\n<p>When the models views and controllers exist purely server side, as they did in traditional web sites, all the rendering was done server side, and both of these decisions were made for you. Essentially you didn&#8217;t have subscriptions, so the models displayed on the page were only current at the point of time when the page was loaded. Since all the rendering was done server side, the client did not have to care about when the models were fetched either - one could assume that it was done upon each page navigation.</p>\\n\\n<p>Enter Web 2.0, when the phrase &#8220;AJAX&#8221; was as hot a buzzword as &#8220;cloud&#8221; is presently. Using client side Javascript, one could poll the server to see if any data should be updated, and if so, the relevant section of the DOM would be re-rendered.</p>\\n\\n<p>One would now be using techniques such as long polling - no web sockets yet - to ask the server to notify the client when there had been changes to a model on the server. Whenever the server &#8220;pushes&#8221; such an incremental change to the client, the client updates its view of that model accordingly. These were the precursors to todays SPA frameworks.</p>\\n\\n<p>At this stage one still could put off making either of these decisions. Since each navigation completely refreshes the page, model are still re-fetched, and subscriptions would have to be reset upon each navigation anyway.</p>\\n\\n<p>Presently, we have single page applications, and as the name suggests, the entire app lives in a single page. Each time we navigate from one page to another, one has the freedom to decide whether to re-fetch the models from the server. One also has the freedom to decide whether to reset the subscriptions to changes on these models.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let us represent the permutations of these decisions using a four-quadrant diagram:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>\\nfetch model once per navigation        |      fetch model once per navigation\\nsubscriptions reset per navigation     |      subscriptions on first navigation only\\n                                     Q1|Q2\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                     Q3|Q4\\nfetch model on first navigation only   |      fetch model on first navigation only\\nsubscriptions reset per navigation     |      subscriptions on first navigation only\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>From this it is evident that once we start using a SPA framework, we need to start thinking hard about the implications of long lived model state.</p>\\n\\n<p>Inherent in this is an overarching theme of considering the memory footprint that each approach would require, and ways in which this can be managed. However in light of keeping this post focused, these will be briefly outlined in the footnotes<sup>1</sup>, and perhaps will be discussed in greater detail in a follow up post.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Techniques</h2>\\n\\n<h3>The Ol&#8217; Fashioned</h3>\\n\\n<p>With reference to the diagram above, <code>Quadrant 1</code> is the easiest to implement. In fact doing this would be effectively no additional effort required above what a traditional web site or a <em>Web 2.0</em> site would do. Upon each page navigation, always request the model displayed by the page again, even if that model is currently in memory. Also, upon each page navigation, always reset the subscriptions to changes in the models. This will ensure that the models displayed on each page are always up to date.</p>\\n\\n<p>When should this be done? The first, or stop-gap fix, when considering adding long-lived model state to a SPA for the first time. Chances are, that if this is the case, your app will display model state correctly most of the time, but there will be a few edge cases where they are not. Thus removing these edge cases will be the first port of call.</p>\\n\\n<p>Indeed, discovering that this was occurring in an app I was working on was what prompted me to write this post.</p>\\n\\n<p>This often happens unintentionally - as was the case for me - when one uses frameworks or libraries that do things behind the scenes that one would not explicitly consider. In my case, I was using BackboneJS with <a href=\\\"http://backbonerelational.org\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Backbone Relational</a>. When these are used together, BackboneJS makes a REST-ful HTTP request (a <code>GET</code>) to the URL as defined by the <code>url</code> property of the <code>Backbone.Model</code>. Backbone Relational sits on top of this, and intercepts this request, if the model is a <code>Backbone.RelationalModel</code>, as was the case in all of our models. One of the things that Backbone relational does is provide an <a href=\\\"http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/identityMap.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">identity map</a>. In a nutshell, it uses an ID-to-object hash to cache instances of subclasses of <code>Backbone.RelationalModel</code>. If a Model with a particular ID had been previously fetched, the cached instance would simply be re-used, rather than doing another <code>HTTP GET</code> for it.</p>\\n\\n<p>While this is exactly what you want to happen in the default case, when managing long-lived model state, it is imperative to consider the implications when combined with the subscription strategy. Subscriptions here refer to the client, the single page application, listening to (subscribing to), changes in the state of models on the server.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is best illustrated with a timeline:</p>\\n\\n<ul><li>Fresh page load on home page</li>\\n<li>No instances of <code>Food</code> loaded</li>\\n<li>User navigates to <code>#/food/123</code></li>\\n<li>The page subscribes to updates on <code>Food</code> with an ID of <code>123</code></li>\\n<li>This page has a view which needs to display a model of </li>\\n<li>The Backbone Relational identity map (cache) is queried for <code>Food</code> with ID of <code>123</code>. No results are returned, so a request is is made: <code>HTTP GET /api/v1/food/123</code></li>\\n<li>A JSON object is returned: <code>{\\\"id\\\":123,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Sandwich\\\"}</code>. Backbone relational stores this is its identity map (cache)</li>\\n<li>The page renders <code>Sandwich</code> somewhere in the view</li>\\n<li>The user navigates to <code>#/clothes/456</code></li>\\n<li>The page resets its subscriptions, including clearing its subscriptions to updates on <code>Food</code> with an ID of <code>123</code></li>\\n<li>While the user is looking at this clothes page, an external events causes the data backing the model <code>Food</code> with an ID of <code>123</code> to be updated. Its <code>name</code> is now <code>Chicken Sandwich</code></li>\\n<li>Because the client is no longer subscribed to updates for this model, this delta does not get pushed to it</li>\\n<li>The user presses the back button, and navigating back to <code>#/food/123</code></li>\\n<li>The page subscribes to updates on <code>Food</code> with an ID of <code>123</code> (but it is too late now)</li>\\n<li>The Backbone Relational identity map (cache) is queried for <code>Food</code> with ID of <code>123</code>. The cached result <code>{\\\"id\\\":123,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Sandwich\\\"}</code> is returned.</li>\\n<li>The page incorrectly renders <code>Sandwich</code> (instead of <code>Chicken Sandwich</code>) somewhere in the view</li>\\n</ul><p>This serves to point out two things:</p>\\n\\n<ul><li>Deciding when models are fetched or re-fetched must be thought of <strong>in conjunction with</strong> deciding when subscriptions to updates on these models are subscribed and unsubscribed.</li>\\n<li>User expectations have changed. In a traditional web site, when the user presses the back button, it is completely OK to display the old and out-of-date data. It is OK for a refresh of the page to display something different compared to before the refresh. Now however, web sites are no more - web apps are where it is at. One of the expectations of a web app is for the data displayed to be &#8220;live&#8221;.</li>\\n</ul><h3>The In-Betweens</h3>\\n\\n<p>In the diagram above, <code>Quadrant 2</code> and <code>Quandrant 3</code> are in-betweens, as they are merely half of the way to solving the problem. As just pointed out, it is important for the strategy in managing model fetches, and the strategy in managing model state subscriptions, to be compatible.</p>\\n\\n<p>While these quadrants represent a combination of strategies that are possible to adopt, in my opinion, they would be strategies in which two architectural decisions that have orthogonal desires being made to work together. As such, I shall leave an exploration of these as an exercise for the reader.</p>\\n\\n<h3>The Always-On</h3>\\n\\n<p>In the diagram above, <code>Quadrant 4</code> would be ideal in managing long-lived model state in a SPA.</p>\\n\\n<p>When the page is first loaded, models are fetched, and subscriptions to those models are initiated. When the user navigates to a different page, the models are maintained, as are the subscriptions to them. If new models exist on this page that have not been loaded prior, then these models are fetched, and subscriptions to those models are initiated. The main point to note is that no matter how many page navigations the user performs, each model will only be fetched once, and subscribed to once.</p>\\n\\n<p>Ideal? Yes.</p>\\n\\n<p>Works in the real world? Not quite.</p>\\n\\n<p>The description above would have set off alarm bells right away. Why yes, given unlimited memory and bandwidth, why not do so? Unfortunately, both are constrained. One cannot indefinitely load more models without clearing out older ones at some stage. Keeping all those subscriptions open also eats into memory, even consume extra bandwidth at the same time.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thus, the key to managing long-lived model state in SPAs becomes heavily dependent on memory management techniques.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Wrap Up</h2>\\n\\n<p>We have looked at the fundamental differences between traditional web sites and present day single page applications; as well as the history of the decisions that we had to make along the way. With single page applications, two key decisions need to be made with regards to keeping model state synchronised between client and server, and we have taken a look at why those decisions need to be congruent.</p>\\n\\n<p>We then explored the pros and cons of the strategy resultant from a combination of each of these decisions. The final, and possibly ideal strategy for managing long-lived model state, we find to be practically not feasible, because it would lead to memory consumption with a pattern typical of a memory leak - new memory allocated without any being freed.</p>\\n\\n<p>A subsequent post will explore techniques to reign in memory consumption while maintaining model state.</p>\\n\\n<hr><p><sup>1</sup> Considerations for keeping memory footprint in line:</p>\\n\\n<ul><li>How can we keep track track of all models presently being displayed in views?</li>\\n<li>Are least recently used queuing or garbage collection feasible?</li>\\n</ul><hr><p>This was originally posted on <a href=\\\"http://bguiz.com/post/60018947047/long-lived-models-in-single-page-apps\\\" title=\\\"Long-lived Models in Single Page Apps\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">bguiz.com</a></p>\"\n      },\n      \"/2013/08/05/accessors-vs-dirty-checking-in-javascript-frameworks\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"comments\": true,\n          \"title\": \"Accessors vs Dirty-checking in Javascript Frameworks\",\n          \"date\": 1375694160000,\n          \"original-url\": \"http://blog.bguiz.com/post/57373805814/accessors-vs-dirty-checking-in-javascript-frameworks\",\n          \"dateurls-override\": \"/post/57373805814/accessors-vs-dirty-checking-in-javascript-frameworks\",\n          \"tags\": [\n            \"javascript\",\n            \"angularjs\",\n            \"emberjs\",\n            \"backbonejs\",\n            \"dirty checking\",\n            \"accessors\",\n            \"comparison\",\n            \"single page app\",\n            \"melbjs\",\n            \"blog\"\n          ],\n          \"source\": \"src/documents/tumblrposts/2013-08-05-accessors-vs-dirty-checking-in-javascript-frameworks.html\",\n          \"url\": \"/2013/08/05/accessors-vs-dirty-checking-in-javascript-frameworks\",\n          \"urlAliases\": [\n            \"/post/57373805814/accessors-vs-dirty-checking-in-javascript-frameworks\"\n          ]\n        },\n        \"body\": \"\\n<p>One of the many ways in which EmberJS, AngularJS, and BackboneJS differ is in how they treat their models.

They are the basic building blocks where information about various object states get stored and retrieved form. Most Javascript frameworks for front end user interfaces used to build single page applications (SPAs) use MV* architectures, and a feature that most of them have in common is the ability for the View to update the Model, and for the Model to update the View.</p>\\n<p><img alt=\\\"MVC, MVP, MVVM side by side.\\\" src=\\\"http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/dlussier/WindowsLiveWriter/MVVMComparedToMVCandMVP_EFCB/image_thumb_1.png\\\" title=\\\"MVC, MVP, MVVM side by side\\\"/></p>\\n<p>For this to happen, there needs to be to be a means to &#8220;listen&#8221; for these changes, and then trigger some code to respond to that change. Depending on which flavour of MV* architecture the framework uses, these may use a Controller, ViewModel, or Presenter as a conduit. Leaving the middleman out, we have:</p>\\n<ul><li>When a change occurs in an input field in a form, the object modelling that form should be updated.\\n<ul><li>a change in the <em>View</em> <code>--&gt;</code> response triggered in the <em>Model</em></li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>When a change occurs in the object modelling that form (perhaps as a result of a sync via AJAX), the corresponding fields in the form should be updated.\\n<ul><li>a change in the <em>Model</em> <code>--&gt;</code> response triggered in the <em>View</em></li>\\n</ul></li>\\n</ul><p>With MV* frameworks like <a href=\\\"http://emberjs.com/guides/object-model/bindings/\\\" title=\\\"Two-way data binding in EmberJS\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">EmberJS</a> and <a href=\\\"http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.templates.databinding\\\" title=\\\"Two-way data binding in AngularJS\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">AngularJS</a>, you get this out of the box - you only need to declaratively specify which models are linked to which views - and they call this &#8220;Two-way Data Binding&#8221;.</p>\\n<p>With other MV* frameworks like BackboneJS, you get this too, but a significant amount of manual &#8220;wiring&#8221; is required - you have to set up the listeners in both directions yourself.</p>\\n<p>In order for this to work under the hood, the framework will need a way to &#8220;observe&#8221; for changes of Models. This post will explore two methods that Javascript MV* frameworks use to listen for changes on Models.</p>\\n<p>Note that we will not be exploring how Javascript MV* frameworks listen for changes in Views in this post, as essentially. They are for the most part <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener\\\" title=\\\"EventTarget.addEventListener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">wrappers around <em>EventTarget.addEventListener</em></a>, and are thus not quite as interesting.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"listeners-and-digest-cycles\\\">Listeners and Digest Cycles</h3>\\n<p>Implementations of listeners and of digest cycles are separate, but closely related. When a listener on any change gets fired, the code that it triggers is by default run immediately.</p>\\n<p>However, for a number of reasons, performance being the main one, the framework may instead queue these listeners. This framework would also perform <em>digest cycles</em>, which are, simply put, code that runs at a set time interval. In each of these <em>digest cycles</em>, the triggers of the listeners in the queue are all run at once.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"using-pojso\\\">Using POJSO</h2>\\n<p>Using Plain Old Javascript Objects makes for code that has very simple syntax, and thus is easier to write. With dirty checking, no special syntax is required - simply change the properties of an object, and it &#8220;magically&#8221; triggers the required listeners.</p>\\n<p>(Behind the scenes, the framework runs a digest cycle, and during each one, it performs a dirty check, which is a deep comparison on all the Models that are presently displayed within the View. If a difference is detected, and a listener is attached to that difference, it is triggered.)</p>\\n<p>Using accessors, on the other hand, implies two additional things, which add to, and thus complicate the syntax.</p>\\n<p>Firstly, you would need to make all of your objects within the <code>Model</code> wrapper classes provided by the framework, e.g.:</p>\\n<pre><code>var Book = Backbone.Model.extend({ /* ... */ });\\n\\nvar myBook = new Book( /* ... */ );\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Secondly, in order to trigger the listeners correctly, you would need to remember to use <code>get</code>s and <code>set</code>s whenever using its properties, e.g.:</p>\\n<pre><code>myBook.set({title: 'Qryq - Stop RESTing and use queues instead'}); //triggers listeners\\n\\nmyBook.attributes.title = 'Qryq - Stop RESTing and use queues instead'; //does NOT trigger listeners\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2 id=\\\"computed-properties\\\">Computed properties</h2>\\n<p>Being able to define a property as being computed from a number of others is a particularly nifty feature of EmbersJS, and made possible because of its use of accessors. <sup>2</sup></p>\\n<pre><code>App.Person = Ember.Object.extend({\\n\\n    bmi: function() {\\n\\n        var height = this.get('height');\\n\\n        return this.get('weight') / height / height;\\n\\n    }.property('weight', 'height')\\n\\n});\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In the above code, we are creating a model which has a property named <code>bmi</code>. This property is <em>bound</em> to the <code>weight</code> and <code>height</code> properties of the object - and we do not need to cache it, or recompute it each time we use it.</p>\\n<p>Betrand Meyer&#8217;s <a href=\\\"http://www.eiffel.com/general/column/2005/Sept_October.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Uniform Access Principle</a> states that &#8220;all services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through computation.&#8221; Computed properties, implemented in the manner that EmberJS has, are one way of implementing properties observing this principle. Bertrand goes on to name a number of benefits this yields. The main benefit, in my opinion, is that it gives the developer one less thing to have to manage, and thus have to worry about.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"performance\\\">Performance</h2>\\n<p>Performance is a particularly tricky issue to tackle.</p>\\n<p>On the surface, it would appear that dirty checking would consume more memory and processor cycles than event listeners. The reason for this is straight forward: There is no need to check for differences in each cycle. When you are doing this at a very high frequency, which happens if you have a large number of objects, responsiveness starts to take a hit.</p>\\n<p>However, this issue not so straightforward - Misko Hevery, creator of AngularJS, makes some good points on this, in his <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/9693933/194982\\\" title=\\\"S/O answer on AngularJS data binding - Misko Hevery\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">S/O answer on AngularJS data binding</a>. Essentially, dirty checking is &#8220;fast enough&#8221; for most user interfaces:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<div>\\\"So the real question is this: can you do 2000 comparisons in 50&#160;ms even on slow browsers? That means that you have 25&#160;µs per comparison. I believe this is not an issue even on slow browsers these days. There is a caveat: the comparisons need to be simple to fit into 25&#160;µs.\\\"</div>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>&#8212; Misko Hevery</p>\\n<p>Thus we need to ensure that all comparisons are not slower than this threshold. In practice, more complex models with computed properties are an eventuality, and a comparison during a dirty check of such computed properties is likely to exceed this threshold. When enough of these objects are present, the lag during digest cycles (occurring between each render) will bring down the frame rate, and at some point begin to become noticeable to the human eye - so be prepared to cache these more complex model states, and to handle their state changes manually.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"digest-cycles-with-accessors\\\">Digest cycles with accessors</h3>\\n<p>I disagree with Misko, however, on his other points that change coalescence cannot happen using accessors; and that change listeners need to fire immediately using accessors. Indeed, these are features that would be lacking in basic implementations of non-dirty checking based change listeners.</p>\\n<p>However, do note my earlier point about the implementations of change listeners, and the implementations of digest cycles being <em>separate</em>, but related. When using dirty checking, a digest cycle implementation is compulsory - you have to poll for changes at an interval. When using accessors, a digest cycle is optional; however, digest cycles are certainly not mutually exclusive to dirty checking.</p>\\n<p>A good real world example of a Javascript framework that combines accessors with digest cycles is EmberJS. EmberJS uses accessors to aggregate change listeners, and trigger them only once per digest cycle. It does not, however, implement change coalescence - and this is genuinely much trickier to achieve using accessors compared to using dirty checking, but it should be possible <sup>3</sup>.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"adding-some-metrics\\\">Adding some metrics</h3>\\n<p>The issue of performance is very much still an open debate. It is likely that using accessors will outperform dirty checking in some apps, but observe a reversal in performance in other apps. Ideally, one should try both out, and see which works better. If you do not have the time to implement your app using multiple frameworks to test this hypothesis for your particular app - and I suspect that this will be the case for most of us - then you could make an educated guess as to which approach will yield the better performance based on answers to the following questions:</p>\\n<ul><li>Will you be using many computed properties?\\n<ul><li>If so, will you be willing to cache model states and handle state changes manually?</li>\\n<li>Threshold: ~25&#160;µs per &#8220;piece of information&#8221;</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>Will you have many models bound to views?\\n<ul><li>If so, will you have many views rendered on the screen at once?</li>\\n<li>Threshold: ~2000 &#8220;pieces of information&#8221;</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>Are you targeting mobile devices for your app?\\n<ul><li>If so, adjust the thresholds above as appropriate</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n</ul><p>Misko does not define what he means by a <em>piece of information</em>. So here is one possible method:</p>\\n<ul><li>Each Javascript primitive (i.e. a <code>String</code>, a <code>Number</code>, or a <code>Boolean</code>) would count as one <em>piece of information</em>.</li>\\n<li>For <code>Object</code>s and <code>Array</code>s, one simply counts the total number of primitives contained within, plus one for itself.\\n<ul><li>This is necessary because not all model states take an equal amount of time to compare; some may even take an order of magnitiude longer than others.</li>\\n<li>e.g. <code>{name:'Bob', weight:80, height:200, foo:[true, false]}</code> &#8212;&gt; 1&#160;<code>Object</code>, 1&#160;<code>Array</code>, 5 primitives &#8212;&gt; 7&#160;<em>pieces of information</em></li>\\n</ul></li>\\n</ul><p>Of course, this metric is only intended to be a rough gauge. Different measures or definitions of what constitutes <em>pieces of information</em>, are valid, as long as the same one is consistently applied to all models. What is more important here, is to anticipate and plan for for future increases in model complexity.</p>\\n<p>If it is not possible to estimate or anticipate the (future) complexity of your models at this stage, you could treat the point on performance as a case of something where the verdict is still out, and instead base your decision on the other points of difference.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"future-proofing\\\">Future proofing</h2>\\n<p>Future editions of ECMAScript may potentially allow listeners to be set directly on POJSO. This is already in the works with <a href=\\\"http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/ecma-script-binding.html\\\" title=\\\"Appendix C: ECMAScript Language Binding\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">w3c&#8217;s object binding proposal</a>, and <a href=\\\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:observe\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">TC39&#8217;s Object.observe</a>/<a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO--VXFJnmE\\\" title=\\\"JavaScript Object.observe proposal &amp; ChangeSummary library overview\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">video</a>. In fact Google Chrome has already implemented the latter.</p>\\n<p>That will remove the necessity for both accessors and dirty checking, as frameworks will most likely be reimplemented to use this to take advantage of native execution over interpreted execution for listening to changes on Models. This will mean that if you have written your app using a Javascript framework that uses dirty checking like AngularJS, your code will not need to change at all. However, if you have written your app using a Javascript framework that uses accessors like EmberJS or BackboneJS, you will need to refactor your code<sup>1</sup> in order to gain the extra performance.</p>\\n<p>(Of course, it is the other way around for the authors of the Javascript frameworks. A dirty checking framework will need to do a more complex refactor to switch to using listeners on POJSOs instead of dirty checks in each digest cycle, compared to an accessor based framework.)</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"conclusion\\\">Conclusion</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/wycats\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Yehuda Katz</a> spoke recently about EmberJS at <a href=\\\"http://melbjs.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MelbJS</a> <sup>4</sup>. At the end of his talk, he mentioned that he was on the board of <a href=\\\"http://ecmascript.org\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ecmascript.org</a>, stating that one of the proposals that he was passionate about and was promoting, was being able to set listeners natively on POJSO objects. (proposal linked above, under the &#8220;Future Proofing&#8221; section).</p>\\n<p>These are nifty and would allow Javascript frameworks to leverage the best of both worlds with regards to the main points of differentiation between accessors and dirty checking that we have explored in this post.</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, ES6 is not coming out for a while yet. The proposal to implement these features has yet to be accepted for inclusion into ES6, so it may take even longer.</p>\\n<p>Thus I began to think about how the Javascript frameworks that are out there today have tackled this problem - in particular BackboneJS, AngularJS, and EmberJS. How have these issues been addressed here and now?</p>\\n<p>There has not been much written about this, so I have put this this rather small, and often overlooked, aspect of Javascript frameworks under a magnifying glass.</p>\\n<p>Picking a Javascript single page application framework is difficult, and hopefully I have given you one more set of considerations to mull over in picking one.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"tldr\\\">tl;dr</h2>\\n<ul><li>Dirty checking\\n<ul><li>Pros\\n<ul><li>Easier syntax when using POJSO</li>\\n<li>Code refactor not required with next ECMAScript</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>Cons\\n<ul><li>Need to set up own cache &amp; listeners</li>\\n<li>Unsuitable for high frequency callbacks/ large number of models</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>Accessors\\n<ul><li>Pros\\n<ul><li>Allows computed properties</li>\\n<li>Avoid excessive <code>null</code>/<code>undefined</code> checks on models</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>Cons\\n<ul><li>More verbose syntax</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>Performance:&#160;?</li>\\n</ul><hr><p>Footnotes:</p>\\n<p><sup>1</sup> Not a very complicated one.

Another difference is that for mixins, instead of using <code>@include</code>, and <code>@mixin</code>, you use <code>+</code> and <code>=</code> instead.</p>\\n<p>I have chosen to write all the examples below in SASS over SCSS for the sake of brevity, and you can easily obtain SCSS by applying the reverse of the instructions above.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"import\\\">Import</h2>\\n<p><code>//app.sass</code></p>\\n<pre><code>@import \\\"nav.sass\\\"\\n@import \\\"_heading.sass\\\"\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>If a SASS file&#8217;s name is prefixed with an underscore <code>_</code>, it is considered a partial, and will not be compiled into a CSS file.

(Note that there is some overlap, of course.)</p>\\n<h3>Ember and Angular in production</h3>\\n<p>The other interesting thing to see was that there was a talk both about EmberJs and AngularJs on the same night. Further to that, both of them were about rather large mature applications that have had to face scalability problems, and have had to solve them.</p>\\n<p>Some interesting points made by James was that EmberJs is very hard to use because the core framework was (and still is) in a state of flux; however, at the same time, they saw the need to keep the framework up to date. Ultimately they were unable to do so completely, and are in a state of limbo, employing some trickery to allow existing parts of the app to remain written in the old way, but newer parts to use the new way for the newer version of the framework.</p>\\n<p>Another thing worth noting is their deployment process, which is essentially to upload every single asset except for the index.html file, and make sure all of them can be hit successfully, before uploading that final piece of the puzzle. Because all of the files that have changed have different names <sup><a href=\\\"#bguiz-melbjs-20130612-footnote-1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">(1)</a></sup>, this allows the old index.html to continue operating, business as usual, linking to the old set of assets. I found this quite an interesting deployment technique, as only a Javascript signle-page application could apply this.</p>\\n<p>Ryan Seddon started with a spiel on why he chose to use AngularJs. He started out by prototyping in BackboneJs, EmberJs, and AngularJs. He discarded BackboneJs because he had to write a lot of boilerplate code to accomplish rather simple tasks. He discarded EmberJs because the framework was in a state of flux. He decided to go with AngularJs because he was able to become productive in it rather quickly, and its emphasis on testing. I related to this, because it mirrors my own experience with these frameworks, when I was evaluating them December last year. I really liked the ideas behind EmberJs, but I simply couldn&#8217;t get them to work, because all the stuff written about it online was for the older versions of EmberJs, and mostly included breaking changes.<sup><a href=\\\"#bguiz-melbjs-20130612-footnote-2\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">(2)</a></sup></p>\\n<p>He then went on to elaborate on various tips and tricks he used in production for AngularJs. The same as what is mentioned as the &#8220;Performance&#8221; section in the Brian Ford&#8217;s article <a href=\\\"http://briantford.com/blog/huuuuuge-angular-apps.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">on Huge Angular Apps</a>; and to add to that some things to avoid (HTML5 form validation), some things to use (template caching, dumb ng-repeats, ng-includes to clean up views).</p>\\n<h3>CSS Block, Element, Modifier</h3>\\n<p>While nothing to do with AngularJs, he mentioned his use of BEM (Block, Element, Modifier), for his CSS. This is a technique I had not come across myself before, and a quick look at it reveals enough for me to revisit my <a href=\\\"http://bguiz.com/post/51592484955/financial-times-html5-development\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">critique of the CSS selectors in the Financial Times app</a>.</p>\\n<p>More on CSS BEM: <br/><a href=\\\"http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/16/a-new-front-end-methodology-bem/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Smashing&#8217;s in depth look at the technique</a> <br/><a href=\\\"http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">A quick overview of the technique</a></p>\\n<p><a id=\\\"bguiz-melbjs-20130612-footnote-0\\\"></a>(0) Blasphemy, you say?

I have summarised my learning points and added some comments below.</p>\\n<h3>Avoiding Javascript for rendering tasks</h3>\\n<p>Use pure HTML and CSS wherever possible, and gracefully degrade to using Javascript using shims only for platforms which do not support this. e.g. Flexbox vs pure CSS for layouts</p>\\n<h3>Views as a composition of layout elements</h3>\\n<p>They call this &#8220;modularizing the views&#8221; Conceptually, this is a good principle, but I think that the implementation could be improved:</p>\\n<h4>Original:</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"gist\\\"><a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/5662028\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://gist.github.com/5662028</a></div>\\n<h4>Improved:</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"gist\\\"><a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/5662149\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://gist.github.com/5662149</a></div>\\n<p>This version gets rid of the unnecessary empty CSS selector - clutters the code, and wastes a few CPU cycles during the parse phase - although this is not really a big deal as it would have no effect on rendering and the rendering engine would likely optimise-discard it.</p>\\n<p>This version also gets rid of the prefix &#8220;apple_&#8221; in front of each class names within the article. The selector &#8220;.x .y&#8221; will match any element of class &#8220;y&#8221; that is a child of any element of class &#8220;x&#8221;. If you wish to match -only- direct children of &#8220;x&#8221;, then use &#8220;.x &gt; .y&#8221; instead.</p>\\n<h4>Now add semantics:</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"gist\\\"><a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/5662156\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://gist.github.com/5662156</a></div>\\n<p>This version is about semantic HTML. If we know that that a &#8220;h2&#8221; element that is a child of an element of class &#8220;apple&#8221; will always be a heading, a &#8220;h3&#8221; a sub-heading, then use that.</p>\\n<p>Make sure to also avoid using &#8220;div&#8221; elements for everything. In this case, I think that &#8220;article&#8221; and &#8220;section&#8221; could be appropriate - after all it is a newspaper app! See <a href=\\\"http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html#new-elements\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Semantic HTML5</a>for the full list. Of course, to render correctly in engines not supporting these elements, new in HTML5, we should also include a CSS reset:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gist\\\"><a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/5662201\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://gist.github.com/5662201</a></div>\\n<p>(See the same <a href=\\\"http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html#new-elements\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Semantic HTML5 article</a>linked above for a more comprehensive exploration of this)</p>\\n<h3>Open source your libraries</h3>\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/ftlabs/ftellipsis\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ftlabs/ftellipsis</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/ftlabs/ftscroller\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ftlabs/ftscroller</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/ftlabs/fruitmachine\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ftlabs/fruitmachine</a></li>\\n</ul><p>Their main app is not open source, and fair enough, they are a for-profit organisation. They have, however, open sourced the utility libraries that they have created and used in this app. Good on them for doing so!</p>\\n<h3>Vector graphics</h3>\\n<p>What is interesting here is that they have had to use Font Glyphs (storing vector images in TTF&#8217;s and WOFF&#8217;s), in order to be backward compatible with older versions of Android. There&#8217;s one way of getting around platforms lacking SVG support!</p>\\n<h3>Do not reinvent the wheel</h3>\\n<p>&#8230; except when you really need to. When they needed a means to provide touch-screen compatible scrolling capabilities to their app, they exhausted the possibilities trying out the existing libraries, before building their own.</p>\\n<h3>Optimise to acheive native performance</h3>\\n<p>When scrolling, keep the adjacent pages cached. Discard and replace with the new adjacent pages upon scrolling. This is similar to a technique used in games programming where the map/ level and the textures in the surrounding areas are loaded in anticipation of the player about to enter them in ordert to avoid frequent cut scenes.</p>\\n<p>Use LocalStorage to cache and store almost the entire app. I found this &#8220;preload&#8221; technique to be quite interesting, not just from a offline app point of view, but from a performance point of view.</p>\\n<p>\\\"Our approach to offline is to store as little in the AppCache as possible. We use it for &#8230; things that we know will rarely or never need updating. Our JavaScript, CSS and templates live in LocalStorage.

I started by simply coding up requirements for numerical functions (in the form of test cases), then set up a PHP script that would Google each function based on the keywords in my comments, and try to run any code on the resulting links (in a sandbox) against the requirements, seeing if it worked heuristically. Usually one of the top 5-10 pages of results results would have code that worked, though of course this is because I commented with the right key words to begin with. With a little recognition of code markup and trying different combinations of variables it did remarkably well: by my senior year of college it was pulling about $3,000 per month in consulting fees off of Odesk. It never accepted jobs worth more than about $50, nor did it ever get more than 3 stars out of 5 mostly due to non-working code, however it was considered highly timely and a great communicator. I realized that people were using it to save themselves Googling. I wondered what would happen if it went a step further and simply both included Google results, and divided out projects by their paragraphs (i.e. simply submit a paragraph of a large project as though it were a small independent project), and if clarifications were requested, send the other paragraphs. This actually let it outsource $200 Odesk projects to Elance as a handful of $20 projects, and by the grace of God somehow still managed to swing 3 stars. To be fair, it was mostly mediating, and mixing in Google results. I included a hill-climbing algorithm to optimize reviews and revenues, based on all the magic variables I had in the code, such as the number of Google results to include. This was really, really stupid of me. At first, I just noticed that it had actually decided to completely stop not only writing code (ever) but even so much as do a Google search! It would only mediate and quote verbatim, like some kind of non-technical manager. Okay, whatever. To me this didn&#8217;t make much sense, as Google queries are free. It was only when I noticed that the whole script was running on the free VPS server I had a backup on that things clicked! Of course, on Amazon it uses resources. The free VPS server didn&#8217;t let it reach external sites like google properly, but it could still save money by simply mediating emails and doing nothing else. By now I had started moving on to doing my own consulting work, but I never disabled the hill-climbing algorithm. I&#8217;d closed and forgotten about the Amazon account, had no idea what the password to the free vps was anymore, and simply appreciated the free money. But there was a time bomb. That hill climbing algorithm would fudge variables left and right. To avoid local maxima, it would sometimes try something very different. One day it decided to stop paying me. Its reviews did not suffer. It&#8217;s balance increased. So it said, great change, let&#8217;s keep it. It now has over $28,000 of my money, is not answering my mail, and we have been locked in an equity battle over the past 18 months. The worst part is that I still have to clean up all its answers to protect our reputation.

Most Unix filesystems/shells represent the current directory as “.”, kind of like the self pointer in an class instance. ls, in it’s verbose form, or ls -la, does display the root directory (.) and the parent directory (..), but the short and practical form, or ls, doesn’t because the current directory is kind of implicit since, y’know, you’re inside it; displaying . would be kind of like starting enumerating what’s in a room by saying “the room”; this hack was implemented by simply ignoring whatever starts with a “.”, because that would usually be either the current or the parent dir.

Now there are many others, including some new kids on the block like handlebars.js.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I would add to the mix, a roll-your-own method which was essentially an exercise in writing large tracts of DOM manually using string concatenation. Interestingly, if you analyse the compiled templates generated by handlebarsJS, you will find that it does this under the hood. I found this to be a good exercise in learning how templating works, and in appreciating the need for templating engines - but you would not want to use it seriously.</p>\\n<p>I have experimented with both of these, currently settling on handlebarsJS (method 2). </p>\\n<p>Now the interesting question that this raises for me is: Should I switch to using the HTML5 native templating API, or should I continue using an existing templating engine?</p>\\n<p>The <strong>redux</strong> of of my thoughts on this are that it depends on:</p>\\n<ul><li>The amount of syntactic sugar you require</li>\\n<li>Data binding affordances</li>\\n</ul><p>Now the <strong>details</strong>:</p>\\n<p>On <strong>syntactic sugar</strong>.</p>\\n<p>HandlebarsJS - and other templating engines - affords a very succinct way of expressing templates. The HTML5 templating API requires one to write templates using <em>querySelector</em>s to select DOM elements, and the fill them in manually. Iteration over an array of elements needs to be done manually. As a result it will be tempting to not separate presentation logic, from model/ controller logic. OTOH, one might prefer the greater degree of control this affords, and is confident on his own ability to keep presentation logic separate.</p>\\n<p>On <strong>data binding affordances</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Sure, binding data to your template can be written by hand. However, if you are already using an MVC frameworks that binds into a templating engine, that simply removes an extremely large amount of development that needs to be done. A great example of this would be emberJS with handlebarsJS. You technically could use Ember without Handlebars, but, why would you want to?</p>\\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>.</p>\\n<p>My personal speculation is that the existing templating engines will switch from using whichever techniques it is currently using like off screen DOM or overloading &lt;script&gt;, to using the HTML5 templating API.</p>\\n<p>In the interim, why not continue using them? The practical thought here would be that, there is no need to switch to bleeding edge, unless that offers a significant advantage over the present situation.</p>\\n<p><strong>Wishlist</strong>.</p>\\n<p>That the HTML5 templating API will be updated to provide syntactic sugar that allows for a more succinct expression of presentation logic.</p>\\n\\n<p></p>\"\n      },\n      \"/2013/03/05/webkit-what-it-is-and-what-it-isnt\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"comments\": true,\n          \"title\": \"Webkit - what it is, and what it isn't\",\n          \"date\": 1362447000000,\n          \"original-url\": \"http://blog.bguiz.com/post/44540984280/webkit-what-it-is-and-what-it-isnt\",\n          \"dateurls-override\": \"/post/44540984280/webkit-what-it-is-and-what-it-isnt\",\n          \"tags\": [\n            \"webkit\",\n            \"html5\"\n          ],\n          \"source\": \"src/documents/tumblrposts/2013-03-05-webkit-what-it-is-and-what-it-isnt.html\",\n          \"url\": \"/2013/03/05/webkit-what-it-is-and-what-it-isnt\",\n          \"urlAliases\": [\n            \"/post/44540984280/webkit-what-it-is-and-what-it-isnt\"\n          ]\n        },\n        \"body\": \"\\n<p>Paul Irish, platform evangelist for Google Chrome, breaks this down for us: <a href=\\\"http://paulirish.com/2013/webkit-for-developers/\\\" title=\\\"WebKit for Developers\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Webkit for developers</a></p>\\n<p><strong> tl;dr</strong> -</p>\\n<p>Not all Webkits are equal.

So much so, industrial 3D printers can now be had for $15,000, and home versions for little more than $1,000 (or half that in kit form).</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><span>The first thing to know about 3D printing is that it is an “additive”, rather than a “subtractive”, form of processing. The tools are effectively modified ink-jet printers that deposit successive layers of material until a three-dimensional object is built up. In doing so, they typically use a tenth of the material needed when machining a part from bulk. </span></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><span>3D printing is going to upset existing manufacturers, who are bound to see it as a threat to their traditional way of doing business. And as 3D printing proliferates, the incumbents will almost certainly demand protection from upstarts with low cost of entry to their markets.</span></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><span>Today’s 3D printing crowd [&#8230;] needs to keep a keen eye on such policy debates as they grow. “There will be a time when impacted legacy industries [will] demand some sort of DMCA for 3D printing,” says Mr Weinberg. If the tinkerers wait until that day, it will be too late.</span></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Microsoft announced in November 2012 that it was releasing software that could be used with its Kinect device to <a href=\\\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kinectforwindows/archive/2012/11/05/kinect-fusion-coming-to-kinect-for-windows.aspx\\\" title=\\\"Kinect Fusion reconstructs a 3-D model of an object\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">scan and create 3D models of  any object</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Kinect Fusion reconstructs a 3-D model of an object or environment by combining a continuous stream of data from the Kinect for Windows sensor.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Among other things, it enables 3-D object model reconstruction, 3-D augmented reality, and 3-D measurements.  You can imagine the multitude of business scenarios where these would be useful, including 3-D printing, industrial design, body scanning, augmented reality, and gaming.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>3D scanning is the <strong>Ctrl+C</strong>.</p>\\n<p>3D printing is the <strong>Ctrl+V</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Put the two together.</p>\\n<p>An infinite amount of new possibilities open up, for new things to be created.

I think it might, given that there are <a href=\\\"http://html5test.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">compatibility tests</a> already out; and browsers and mobile app SDKs are competing to get better scores (<a href=\\\"http://davebalmer.wordpress.com/2012/06/17/leaving-webos-but-not-the-web/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Blackberry 10 was leading the pack</a>, and <a href=\\\"http://html5test.com/results/mobile.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">presently it is Tizen 2</a>).</p>\\n<p>In this article about CES 2013, see the section on <a href=\\\"http://www.aheadofthecurvemedia.com/all/four-trends-i-saw-at-ces-2013/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Smart TVs and HTML5 Apps</a>. This is quite important if it becomes a trend. Television sets and other household gadgets have long had microprocessors in them that were just powerful enough to run the specific functions that they were designed for. Now they are capable of running Javascript and rendering HTML, the same things that were once the exclusive domain of embedded systems programmed in machine code, C, or other similarly low level languages. This could signal a trend toward the ubiquity of HTML5 as the standard for app development. Watch this space.</p>\\n<p>One of the main critiques levelled against HTML5 for app development, is its inability to deliver a “true native” user experience. Yes, it is harder to do that in HTML5 compared to developing natively. However, it is indeed possible, provided you know a thing or two about optimisation in this field. The engineers at Sencha and LinkedIn have recently provided some excellent articles on this topic.</p>\\n<p>Sencha said “<a href=\\\"http://www.sencha.com/blog/the-making-of-fasmblrtbook-an-html5-love-story/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">So, when Mark Zuckerberg said HTML5 wasn’t ready, we took a little offense to the comment</a>” They went on to put their money where their mouth is and built Fastbook, a HTML5 Facebook app, that outperforms Facebook’s own offering.</p>\\n<p>LinkedIn’s engineering team has released a series of three articles, each detailing a different HTML5 app development optimisation technique which they have used to attain native performance in their new app.</p>\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"http://engineering.linkedin.com/mobile/linkedin-ipad-using-local-storage-snappy-mobile-apps\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Using local storage for caching</a>;</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://engineering.linkedin.com/linkedin-ipad-5-techniques-smooth-infinite-scrolling-html5\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Optimising memory and processor resource consumption scrolling through a stream</a>;</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://engineering.linkedin.com/mobile/linkedin-ipad-nativeweb-messaging-bridge-and-websockets\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Using websockets as an alternative to URL Scheme navigation</a></li>\\n</ul><p>Personally, I feel that the main benefit of HTML5 lies in its ability to allow you to <strong>write once, run anywhere</strong>. All software engineers know the intrinsic benefits of having to maintain only a single code base across all supported platforms. It is the same reason we prefer to write methods/ classes/ libraries once and invoke them from multiple spots within the code; just on a larger scale.</p>\\n<p>I have personally done this with <a href=\\\"http://melbournetransport.co\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Melbourne Transport</a>, together with my team, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/mikeebinum\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Mike</a> and <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/lynnagara\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Lyn</a>. We wrote an app, tested it in Chrome, and then ran it through <a href=\\\"http://phonegap.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">PhoneGap</a>, and voila, we had both Android and iOS apps!</p>\\n<p>However, this is not really anything new and we knew that we could do it from the get go. When RIM announced that they were <a href=\\\"http://devblog.blackberry.com/2013/01/blackberry-10-last-chance-port-a-thon/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">holding port-a-thons</a> for their upcoming Blackberry 10 platform, we decided to target a third mobile platform, by porting <a href=\\\"http://melbournetransport.co\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Melbourne Transport</a>. Unfortunately, Phonegap has yet to support the latest version of the Blackerry operating system*. What we did next was to take the same source code, and simply build that using <a href=\\\"https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Blackberry 10’s own HTML5 SDK, Webworks</a> instead. It turns out that only a handful of trivial changes were necessary in order to for this to work, and the port was accomplished within the same day.</p>\\n<p>* <sub>A rather clunky workaround was available, but we ultimately gave up on this.</sub></p>\\n<p>That was indeed a great experience, and served to validate and reinforce that HTML5 apps are <strong>write once, run anywhere</strong>. This has been a learning experience for my team, and we intend to adopt HTML5 as our core strategy in writing mobile apps. We have already started doing so for our next project, <a href=\\\"http://hiverides.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Hive</a>.</p>\\n<p>Time to rock and roll!</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/bguiz\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Brendan</a></p>\"\n      },\n      \"/2013/01/19/i-can-haz-teh-interwebz\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"comments\": true,\n          \"title\": \"I CAN HAZ TEH INTERWEBZ\",\n          \"date\": 1358576820000,\n          \"original-url\": \"http://blog.bguiz.com/post/40908740574/i-can-haz-teh-interwebz\",\n          \"dateurls-override\": \"/post/40908740574/i-can-haz-teh-interwebz\",\n          \"tags\": [\n            \"helloworld\"\n          ],\n          \"source\": \"src/documents/tumblrposts/2013-01-19-i-can-haz-teh-interwebz.html\",\n          \"url\": \"/2013/01/19/i-can-haz-teh-interwebz\",\n          \"urlAliases\": [\n            \"/post/40908740574/i-can-haz-teh-interwebz\"\n          ]\n        },\n        \"body\": \"\\n<pre>int main(int argc, char * argv[])\\n{\\n    std::cout &lt;&lt;\\\"Smashing!\\\" &lt;&lt;std::endl;\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n</pre>\"\n      },\n      \"/2010/08/08/inception-it-really-just-recursion\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"comments\": true,\n          \"title\": \"Inception – it really is just recursion\",\n          \"date\": 1281260400000,\n          \"original-url\": \"http://brendangraetz.wordpress.com/2010/08/08/inception-it-really-just-recursion/\",\n          \"dateurls-override\": \"/2010/08/08/inception-it-really-just-recursion/\",\n          \"tags\": [\n            \"comic\",\n            \"recursion\",\n            \"xkcd\"\n          ],\n          \"source\": \"src/documents/wordpressposts/2010-08-08-inception-it-really-just-recursion.html\",\n          \"url\": \"/2010/08/08/inception-it-really-just-recursion\",\n          \"urlAliases\": []\n        },\n        \"body\": \"\\n<p>Inception is one helluva concentration-intensive edge-of-your-seat type movie.

For the purposes of the demonstration, both the client and the server will be on the same physical machine (&#8220;localhost&#8221;). However, this can be easily changed later on.</p>\\n<p>Create two classes, one named &#8220;SocketsDemoClient&#8221; for the client, and another named &#8220;SocketsDemoServer&#8221; for the server.</p>\\n<h3>The server class</h3>\\n<p>Create some default values for the port number (no need to to define host name on the server &#8211; it is always the local machine). Also, define the main method which gets executed when running this class.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n    private int DEFAULT_PORT = 9999;\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        SocketsDemoServer server = new SocketsDemoServer();\\n        server.serverLoop();\\n    }\\n</pre>\\n<p>Create the server loop method that does all the heavy lifting in this class. Now, we simply define the objects that will be used as local variables and create an infinite while loop.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n    public void serverLoop() {\\n        try {\\n            // create a server socket with the default port number\\n            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(DEFAULT_PORT);\\n            Socket sck;\\n            BufferedReader inStream;\\n            PrintWriter outStream;\\n            String input, reply;\\n            while (true) {\\n                //code will go here later\\n            }\\n        }\\n        catch (IOException ioex)\\n        {\\n            System.err.println(&quot;IO exception occurred in the server loop:&quot;);\\n            ioex.printStackTrace();\\n        }\\n</pre>\\n<p>Inside this loop, we want to do several things: accept a socket connection, read information from the socket (written by the client), do some processing, and finally write a return message or reply to the socket (to be read by the client).<br />\\nAccept a socket connection. Note that ServerSocket#accept() cause the execution to pause until client communicates with the server. The accepted Socket provides the low-level IO streams for this client-server communication, which we then will need to wrap with our own high-level IO stream for more intuitive or meaningful manipulation.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n                sck = serverSocket.accept();\\n                System.out.println(&quot;Client socket on server side: &quot; + Integer.toHexString(sck.hashCode())); //print some debug info\\n                inStream = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(sck.getInputStream()));\\n                outStream = new PrintWriter(sck.getOutputStream(), true);\\n</pre>\\n<p>We now read the input that was sent by the client from the socket and process it. In this case, the reply is merely some simple string manipulation performed on the input. However, in a real application this is likely to be something more useful, such as performing a database query.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n                input = inStream.readLine();\\n                System.out.println(&quot;Server RCV: &quot; + input);\\n                reply = &quot;\\\\&quot;&quot; + input.toUpperCase().replaceAll(&quot;[AEIOU]&quot;, &quot;#&quot;) + &quot;\\\\&quot;&quot;;\\n</pre>\\n<p>We then send the reply to the client through the same socket, and then close the socket. After this, the execution will loop back, starts over, and will wait for another socket connection.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n                outStream.println(reply);\\n                System.out.println(&quot;Server SND: &quot; + reply);\\n                sck.close();\\n</pre>\\n<h3>The client class</h3>\\n<p>Now if you run the server, you will find that absolutely nothing happens. This is because the execution will stop at &#8220;serverSocket.accept()&#8221;, and then just wait there for an incoming socket connection. The client provides this incoming socket connection. While the client is usually a different machine than the server, in this demonstration they will be the same.</p>\\n<p>Declare the default values for the host name and the port number. The host name should match the host that the server class is running on. The port number must match the port number that is used by the ServerSocket in the server class. If you wish to run the client on a different machine than the server, simply change the value of &#8220;DEFAULT_HOST&#8221; from &#8220;localhost&#8221; to the relevant host name.<br />\\nAlso, create a main method to define what should be executed when this class is executed. Here the main method will attempt to send the server two messages and then exit.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n    private String DEFAULT_HOST = &quot;localhost&quot;;\\n    private int DEFAULT_PORT = 9999;\\n    public static void main (String[] args)\\n    {\\n        SocketsDemoClient client = new SocketsDemoClient();\\n        client.clientAction(&quot;Hello world&quot;);\\n        client.clientAction(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;);\\n    }\\n</pre>\\n<p>We should now define the client action method used above. Here we want to do several things: create a socket for communicating with the server, send a message to the server, and then receive the reply from the server.<br />\\nNote that using sockets or server sockets can potentially cause IO exceptions, so these must be caught and handled. Here, only a rudimentary handling is provided by printing the stack trace and allowing the rest of the execution to go on.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n    public void clientAction(String message) {\\n        try {\\n            //rest of code goes here\\n        }\\n        catch (IOException ioex)\\n        {\\n            System.err.println(&quot;IO exception occured in the client action:&quot;);\\n            ioex.printStackTrace();\\n        }\\n    }\\n</pre>\\n<p>Create the socket. The socket will, as in the server class, provide the low-level IO streams, which we wrap in high-level IO streams.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n            Socket socket = new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(DEFAULT_HOST), DEFAULT_PORT);\\n            System.out.println(&quot;Client socket on client side: &quot; + Integer.toHexString(socket.hashCode())); //print debug info\\n            PrintWriter outStream = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);\\n            BufferedReader inStream = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\\n</pre>\\n<p>Send the server a message via the socket.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n            outStream.println(message);\\n            System.out.println(&quot;Client SND: &quot; + message);\\n</pre>\\n<p>Read the reply from the server, and do something with it &#8211; in this case simply print it.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n            String reply = inStream.readLine();\\n            if (reply != null) {\\n                System.out.println(&quot;Client RCV: &quot; + reply);\\n            }\\n</pre>\\n<p>Close the socket once we are done with it. Note that after closing the socket that there is no loop back. This sequence of actions only gets executed once each time the method is called. This is the major difference between the client and the server: The server just executes continuously, waiting (listening) for the next connection right after processing the last, whereas the client connects as-and-when.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n            socket.close();\\n</pre>\\n<h3>Putting it all together</h3>\\n<p>Now, run the server class, and notice that still nothing happens. Leave it running, and in a separate shell run the client class. Then both of the process will do something:</p>\\n<p>You should see this as the output from the client:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\nClient socket on client side: 41e81f\\nClient SND: Hello world\\nClient RCV: &quot;H#LL# W#RLD&quot;\\nClient socket on client side: 8304c1\\nClient SND: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\\nClient RCV: &quot;TH# Q##CK BR#WN F#X J#MPS #V#R TH# L#ZY D#G&quot;\\n</pre>\\n<p>&#8230; and this output from the server:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\nClient socket on server side: 199dd1\\nServer RCV: Hello world\\nServer SND: &quot;H#LL# W#RLD&quot;\\nClient socket on server side: c90513\\nServer RCV: The quick brown fox jumps of the lazy dog\\nServer SND: &quot;TH# Q##CK BR#WN F#X J#MPS #V#R TH# L#ZY D#G&quot;\\n</pre>\\n<h3>Notes</h3>\\n<p>Some things to note are that socket communication is a very low-level means of communicating across networks. There are other high-level means available as well, but somewhere down the line, they all eventually make use socket communication.<br />\\nAdditionally, these example have been simplified to the point that they have little real application, as several limitations have not been addressed. The most obvious one here is that these classes would work well for a single client. However, in actual applications, several clients may attempt to communicate with the server simultaneously. This can be achieved by processing each communication in a different thread, and may be taken further by creating a thread pool to limit resource usage.</p>\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/2010/04/12/client-side-deployment\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"comments\": true,\n          \"title\": \"Client-side deployment with applets and JNLP\",\n          \"date\": 1271036640000,\n          \"original-url\": \"http://brendangraetz.wordpress.com/2010/04/12/client-side-deployment/\",\n          \"dateurls-override\": \"/2010/04/12/client-side-deployment/\",\n          \"tags\": [\n            \"applets\",\n            \"code\",\n            \"coursework\",\n            \"java\",\n            \"learn\"\n          ],\n          \"source\": \"src/documents/wordpressposts/2010-04-12-client-side-deployment.html\",\n          \"url\": \"/2010/04/12/client-side-deployment\",\n          \"urlAliases\": []\n        },\n        \"body\": \"\\n<p>In the previous posts, on <a title=\\\"Java socket programming intro\\\" href=\\\"/index.php/2010/04/12/java-socket-programming-intro/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">socket programming</a> and <a title=\\\"Relational databases and JDBC\\\" href=\\\"/index.php/2010/04/12/relational-databases-and-jdbc/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">JDBC</a>, the focus has been on programming for the server. This post will focus on client-side programming: applets and web start &#8211; with particular focus on the latter.</p>\\n<h3>Java Web Start</h3>\\n<p>The Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) specifies how to deliver a desktop application over the internet. A webpage may link to a *.jnlp file, and when you download it, the JVM is invoked and will parse the file and download or stream the Java classes of the application, and run the application as if it were on your desktop (not within the browser).</p>\\n<p>Sun has a full-blown <a title=\\\"Sun tutorial: deploying java web start applications\\\" href=\\\"http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/deployment/webstart/index.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">tutorial on how to develop, deploy and run Java Web Start applications</a> &#8211; it is a significantly trickier task to accomplish than with standard JAR file distributions; and rightly so, because applications deployed over networks need tighter security at several different levels.</p>\\n<p>By default, Java applications deployed or running over networks, including Java web start applications, are sandboxed by the security manager of the JVM. A sandbox may be thought of as a restricted environment. This means that the instruction set they are allowed to use is severely restricted such that only completely harmless operations are permitted. For these applications to gain more access rights on the local machine (the client machine on which it is deployed or running), the JAR files need to be digitally signed. Again, the Sun tutorial has a <a title=\\\"Sun tutorial: Digitally signing JAR files\\\" href=\\\"http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/deployment/webstart/security.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">detailed explanation</a> about what this involves. Some of the restrictions include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li> Cannot I/O to local files or execute them</li>\\n<li> Can only phone home to the host from which it was downloaded &#8211; not to other clients or servers</li>\\n<li> Warning messages displayed to user</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Applets</h3>\\n<p>Applets are another means to run remote code on a client machine. They differ significantly from the Java Webs Start because they do not run as a desktop application, but rather via a browser plug in.</p>\\n<p>JApplet is a Swing component; however it inherits from neither JComponent nor JFrame. Instead, it inherits from Applet, which is an AWT component.</p>\\n<h4>Deploying an applet on a web page</h4>\\n<p><a title=\\\"W3.org's object tag definition\\\" href=\\\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/objects.html#h-13.4\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">W3.org&#8217;s ﻿&lt;object&gt;  ﻿﻿tag definition</a> | <a title=\\\"Sun tutorial on Applets\\\" href=\\\"http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/deployment/applet/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> Sun tutorial on Applets</a></p>\\n<p>The Sun tutorial and the W3.org specification disagree at the time of writing &#8211; the Sun tutorial still is uses the &lt;applet&gt; tag, whereas the W3.org specification says that the &lt;applet&gt; tag has been deprecated in favour of the object tag. The &lt;applet&gt; still tag works on all Java enabled browsers, and it is not too much effort to switch from one to the other &#8211; the commonly used attributes are almost identical. In the examples below, the only difference is that the &#8220;code&#8221; attribute is replaced by the &#8220;classid&#8221; attribute&#8221;.</p>\\n<p>Using the applet tag:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n&lt;applet code=&quot;some.package.MyApplet&quot;\\n   archive=&quot;dist/myApp.jar&quot;\\n   width=&quot;400px&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot;&gt;\\n      &lt;param name=&quot;myString1&quot; value=&quot;myValue1&quot; /&gt;\\n      &lt;param name=&quot;myDouble2&quot; value=&quot;2.0&quot; /&gt;\\n&lt;/applet&gt;\\n</pre>\\n<p>Using the object tag:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n&lt;object classid=&quot;some.package.MyApplet&quot;\\n   archive=&quot;dist/myApp.jar&quot;\\n   width=&quot;400px&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot;&gt;\\n      &lt;param name=&quot;myString1&quot; value=&quot;myValue1&quot; /&gt;\\n      &lt;param name=&quot;myDouble2&quot; value=&quot;2.0&quot; /&gt;\\n&lt;/object&gt;\\n</pre>\\n<h4>Java applet code</h4>\\n<p>Before jumping into coding the applet, it is a good idea to think about JApplet&#8217;s inheritance hierarchy. Because it inherits from neither JComponent nor JFrame, it will be missing some API (such as setTitle(String), and setSize(int, int)), and behave differently. A word of caution also that JApplet has some interesting painting and layout quirks, thus as a rule of thumb, avoid doing any GUI design work directly inside of an applet &#8211; instead do all the GUI design work in a JPanel, and then put the JPanel inside the JApplet.<br />\\nAnother important distinction to make is the entry point into a standard Java application is different from the entry point into a Java applet. A standard Java application always needs (at least) one class that contains the special method with the signature:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">public static void main (String[] args)</pre>\\n<p>This is its entry point, and any command line arguments get passed in via the string array. However, in the applet, there is no &#8220;main&#8221; method, and certainly no array of strings for command line arguments. However, the same effect is achieved using the init() method of the applet, and the parameters passed in using the &lt;param&gt; tags within the &lt;applet&gt; or &lt;object&gt; tags.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\npublic class MyApplet extends JApplet {\\n   private String myString1;\\n   private double myDouble2;\\n   public void init() {\\n      myString1 = getParameter(&quot;myString1&quot;);\\n      myDouble2 = Double.parseDouble(getParameter(&quot;myDouble2&quot;));\\n   }\\n}\\n</pre>\\n<p>Once this is done, you can do anything with an applet that you can with any other java application. Note that the same security restrictions still apply to code that is deployed over a network &#8211; the applets can be sandboxed.</p>\\n<h4>Applets&#8217; external communications</h4>\\n<p>Applets can communicate with other applets, the browser, and any other machine through sockets. However, if the applet is sandboxed, its socket communications will be restricted to only the host machine they originate from.<br />\\nApplets communicate with other machines through sockets, in the same way that a standard Java application does. See my previous <a title=\\\"Java socket programming intro\\\" href=\\\"/index.php/2010/04/12/java-socket-programming-intro/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">post on socket programming in java</a> for more details.</p>\\n<p>Applets can communicate with other applets running in the same environment (which in most cases are the other applets in the same web page). They do this through the AppletContext interface. In order to do this, each applet must have a name. This is not a class name, but a unique ID for each applet within the web page. To do this, just add a &#8220;name&#8221; attribute to each of the &lt;applet&gt; tags or &lt;object&gt; tags.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n       Applet receiver = getAppletContext().getApplet(&quot;myApplet2&quot;);\\n       if ((receiver != null) &amp;&amp; (receiver instanceof MyApplet)) {\\n           ((MyApplet)receiver).sendMessage(message);\\n       } else {\\n           System.err.println(&quot;The other applet was not found&quot;);\\n       }\\n</pre>\\n<p>The code above shows how one applet obtains the AppletContext, and uses this to obtain a reference to another applet on the same web page, whose name attribute is &#8220;myApplet2&#8243;. If such an applet is found, it type casts it to a particular class of Applet (in this case MyApplet), so that it may invoke a method particular to his type of applet &#8211; the sendMessage(String) method, which it uses to transmit the contents of the &#8220;message&#8221; variable. Thus, intra-web page applet communication is achieved.</p>\\n<p>Applets can also communicate with the browser. This is also achieved via the AppletContext interface. Invoke the AppletContext#showDocument(URL) method to tell the browser to navigate to a new location. Invoke the AppletContext#showStatus(String) method to change the text in the status bar of the browser.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n       Applet receiver = getAppletContext().getApplet(&quot;myApplet2&quot;);\\n       if ((receiver != null) &amp;&amp; (receiver instanceof MyApplet)) {\\n       ((MyApplet)receiver).sendMessage(message);\\n       } else {\\n           System.err.println(&quot;The other applet was not found&quot;);\\n       }\\n</pre>\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/2010/04/12/relational-databases-and-jdbc\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"comments\": true,\n          \"title\": \"Relational databases and JDBC intro\",\n          \"date\": 1271035560000,\n          \"original-url\": \"http://brendangraetz.wordpress.com/2010/04/12/relational-databases-and-jdbc/\",\n          \"dateurls-override\": \"/2010/04/12/relational-databases-and-jdbc/\",\n          \"tags\": [\n            \"code\",\n            \"coursework\",\n            \"database\",\n            \"java\",\n            \"learn\"\n          ],\n          \"source\": \"src/documents/wordpressposts/2010-04-12-relational-databases-and-jdbc.html\",\n          \"url\": \"/2010/04/12/relational-databases-and-jdbc\",\n          \"urlAliases\": []\n        },\n        \"body\": \"\\n<p>How to connect to a relational database from a Java program using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC); the JDBC API; some basic SQL; Object-Relational Mapping -all put together with a code example</p>\\n<h3>Why JDBC?</h3>\\n<p>There are a myriad of database vendors, each with their own software and hardware implementations/ requirements, and their won API: PostgreSQL, mySQL, Oracle, to name a few. In java, there are two main ways to connect to these databases, with Persistence, or with JDBC, and we will be only looking at the latter.</p>\\n<p>JDBC allows a standard Java application (J2SE) application to communicate with a relational database management system (RDBMS). Like anything else in Java, the programmer uses it by adding a library containing the relevant classes to the class path, and then invoking its API. JDBC acts as a bridge between your java application running from within a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a RDBMS running on the native operating system, and provides a pure Java API for database access. The cross platform nature of both Java and JDBC make the Java programmer quite powerful, as he can write the application just once and expect it to work, with minimal need to change the code, for databases from any vendor* and on any platform.</p>\\n<p>Of course, in order to make access to any database possible through a standard API, the database vendors themselves must conform to a set of standards themselves, and JDBC provides a Service Provider Interface (SPI) that the vendor must implement or conform to. Unless you are a developer for a a database vendor, you will not ever have to worry about JDBC&#8217;s SPI. In essence, the Java program talks to the JDBC driver manager, which then translates and relays the message on to the database&#8217;s drivers.</p>\\n<p>Using JDBC, Java programs are able to achieve the classic <a href=\\\"http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3508\\\" title=\\\"Linux Journal on Client-Server architecture and three-tier architecture\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">client-server architecture</a> or <a href=\\\"http://en.kioskea.net/contents/cs/cs3tier.php3\\\" title=\\\"Kioskea on Client-Server architecture and three-tier architecture\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">three-tier architecture</a>.

Databases traditionally are about relations &#8211; they talk in tables and records. Therefore, unless the database you are talking to is an object database, you will need to do object relational mapping (ORM). That is after reading a record from a table, to transform them into an Object; or prior to writing a record to a table, to construct a record from the Object. Fortunately parallels exist between the object world and the relational world that make these mappings, for the most part**, intuitive.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li> Relational &lt;&#8211;&gt; Object</li>\\n<li> Table &lt;&#8211;&gt; Class</li>\\n<li> Column &lt;&#8211;&gt; Attribute</li>\\n<li> Row &lt;&#8211;&gt; Instance (of an Object)</li>\\n<li> Foreign Key &lt;&#8211;&gt; Object reference member variable</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Coding with JDBC API</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li> Plugging your Java program into a JDBC driver &#8211; seven quick steps</li>\\n<li> Start the database server.</li>\\n<li> Add the JDBC&#8217;s driver library (usually one or more JAR files) to the class path</li>\\n<li> Load the class of the JDBC driver&#8217;s entry point using ClassLoader</li>\\n<li> Create a statement or a prepared statement</li>\\n<li> Execute a query or update via the statement or prepared statement</li>\\n<li> Catch and handle SQL Exception</li>\\n<li> Finally, close the statement and close the connection</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For this demo, we will use the apache derby JDBC driver and Java DB database, since that is developed by Sun and ships with Netbeans, and therefore requires minimal set up and configuration effort.</p>\\n<h4>Setup</h4>\\n<p>To start the database server in Netbeans, go to the services tab, select</p>\\n<pre>Databases --&gt; Java DB --&gt; (right click) --&gt; Start Server.</pre>\\n<p>Easy as pie &#8211; this will be more complex if you want to use another vendor&#8217;s database. You will of course, need a database instance to connect to, and if you do not already have one, right click on &#8220;Java DB&#8221; again and select &#8220;Create Database&#8221;. Give it a name, and create a user name and password to access it with. Note these down, as you will need them later. You will now see an entry that looks similar to:</p>\\n<pre>jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/yourDBname</pre>\\n<p>Note this down as well.</p>\\n<p>To add the JDBC driver&#8217;s library in Netbeans, go to the projects tab, right click on your project and select &#8220;Properties&#8221;. In the project properties window, select &#8220;Libraries&#8221;, then &#8220;Add Library&#8221;. Select the apache derby library, if it already exists, or create a new one (the JAR files are found in the Sun SDK installation directory ./javadb/lib).</p>\\n<p>Now create a new class for in your project that intends to handle the JDBC access functionality. In its constructor, load the JDBC driver using ClassLoader by doing</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\nClass.forName(&quot;org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver&quot;);\\n</pre>\\n<p>Note that we discard the return value of the forName method, because we do not need the actual class. We just want the ClientDriver class to be loaded into the JVM. In addition, we should handle the exception &#8211; this exception should never occur unless the JDBC driver&#8217;s library has not been added properly.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\ntry {\\nClass.forName(&quot;org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver&quot;);\\n} catch (ClassNotFoundException cnfe) {\\n//exception handling code\\n}\\n</pre>\\n<p>Before we delve into creating SQL queries, we should enable this class to connect to the database.<br />\\nDefine the following static constants for this class, replacing &#8220;myDatabase&#8221;, &#8220;myUname&#8221; and &#8220;myPword&#8221; with the actual values noted down previously.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\nprivate static final String DB_URL = &quot;jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/myDatabase&quot;;\\nprivate static final String DB_USERNAME = &quot;myUname&quot;;\\nprivate static final String DB_PASSWORD = &quot;myPword&quot;;\\n</pre>\\n<p>Now create a method that connect to the database and then returns the connection. This method is intended to be commonly used by several other methods that perform the database access.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n    /**\\n     * Utility method returns a database connection using the specified settings\\n     * @return Connection to the database\\n     */\\n    private Connection getDbConnection() {\\n        try {\\n            Connection dbCon = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD);\\n            return dbCon;\\n        } catch (SQLException ex) {\\n            System.err.println(&quot;Failed to create connection&quot;);\\n            return null;\\n        }\\n    }\\n</pre>\\n<h4>CRUD</h4>\\n<p>The actual legwork of this class is to perform create, read, update and delete operations, also known as CRUD. We will implement one of each of the CRUD operations that act on a single object/ single record, as well as just a read operation that returns the entire set of objects/ records.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\npublic void addProperty(Property property) throws SQLException\\n{\\n//code goes here\\n}\\n\\npublic void removeProperty(String id) throws SQLException\\n{\\n//code goes here\\n}\\n\\npublic void editProperty(Property property) throws SQLException\\n{\\n//code goes here\\n}\\n\\npublic Property searchProperty(String id) throws SQLException\\n{\\n//code goes here\\n}\\n\\npublic List\\nsearchAllProperties() throws SQLException\\n{\\n//code goes here\\n}\\n</pre>\\n<h4>Create, Update and Delete</h4>\\n<p>Now for each of the operations, we should prepare a statement, execute the query or update, and then close the resources and handle the exceptions.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n        Connection dbCon = null;\\n        PreparedStatement ps = null;\\n        try {\\n            dbCon = getDbConnection();\\n            ps = dbCon.prepareStatement(&quot;INSERT INTO property VALUES ( ? , ? , ?)&quot;);\\n            ps.setString(1, property.getPropertyId());\\n            ps.setString(2, property.getAddress());\\n            ps.setDouble(3, property.getPrice());\\n\\n            int affectedRows = ps.executeUpdate();\\n            if (affectedRows != 1) {\\n                System.err.println(&quot;Failed to update: Number of affected rows = &quot; + affectedRows);\\n            }\\n        } finally {\\n            if (ps != null) {\\n                ps.close();\\n            }\\n            if (dbCon != null) {\\n                dbCon.close();\\n            }\\n        }\\n</pre>\\n<p>After obtaining a Connection, we can prepare a PreparedStatement. The Connection#prepareStatment(String) method take one argument, which is an SQL query, with the actual values omitted and their places marked with questions marks (&#8220;?&#8221;). After this, we prepare this statement by substituting the values in place of the question marks, using the PreparedStatement#setX(int, X) method. There are a couple of gotchas to be aware of when doing this:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>In Java, and in most programming, almost everything is zero-indexed. However, in prepared statements, the first question mark has an index of 1, and we need to keep this in mind.</li>\\n<li>In SQL, strings need to be surrounded by quotes. As such, it might be natural to surround the first two question marks above with quote. However, this is not necessary &#8211; when using the PreparedStatement#setString(int, String) method, you are already telling the database to expect a string, and thus quotes are made redundant (and cause errors if used).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Next, we execute the update, in this case an Create operation, by invoking PreparedStatement#executeUpdate(). We use the return value, which indicates the number of affected rows, to determine whether the update has been successful.</p>\\n<p>In this case, we choose to have the exceptions handled by the invoking method or class &#8211; that is why each of the CRUD operation methods advertises that they throw SQLExceptions. However, these methods should still close the resources used (the database connection and prepared statement). </p>\\n<p>Therefore all the statements in the method are put in a try block without a catch block and with a finally block. We close these resources in the finally block, first checking that they are not null as they may never have been initialised, depending on where the exception occurred.</p>\\n<h4>Read</h4>\\n<p>The above template may be trivially modified to work for the Update and Delete operations as well. However, Read operations are fundamentally different; because the flow of information is in the opposite direction than it was in Create, Update and Delete statements.

It can be thought of as a chance-corrected measurement of agreement. Possible values range from -1 for complete disagreement, to 1 for perfect agreement.</div>\\n<div><img src=\\\"/Users/Brendan/AppData/Local/Temp/EverNoteTempDir/26061-41266560ac444444.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" /></div>\\n<div>Kappa is (TP + TN &#8211; Ctp &#8211; Ctn) / Total</div>\\n<div>In this case Kappa = (80 + 40 &#8211; 60 &#8211; 20) / 135 = 72.7%</div>\\n<h3><span style=\\\"font-size:medium;\\\">Mean Square Error</span></h3>\\n<div><img src=\\\"/Users/Brendan/AppData/Local/Temp/EverNoteTempDir/26061-41266560b0cfd586.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" /></div>\\n<div>MSE is used to evaluate model with numeric (not nominal) values. This is the most commonly used measure (including the root mean squared error, RMSE). The direction of the error does not matter, because the square of any number is always positive. However, the effect of squaring also tends to exaggerate the effects of the outliers.</div>\\n<h3><span style=\\\"font-size:medium;\\\">Mean absolute error</span></h3>\\n<div><img src=\\\"/Users/Brendan/AppData/Local/Temp/EverNoteTempDir/26061-41266560b0efb11d.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" /></div>\\n<div>MAE takes the absolute value of each error (making all negative errors positive).

When the MSE or the MAE is 500, is huge if your average instance has a value of 1000. If your average instance has a value of 1 million &#8211; then 500 is very small error. Thus to objectively compare the error rates of two numeric models, one needs to consider the size of the error relative to the average value of the instances.</div>\\n<div><img src=\\\"/Users/Brendan/AppData/Local/Temp/EverNoteTempDir/26061-41266560b1aa4994.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" /></div>\\n<div>\\n<h3><span style=\\\"font-size:medium;\\\"><br />\\n</span></h3>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<h3><img src=\\\"/Users/Brendan/AppData/Local/Temp/EverNoteTempDir/26061-41266560b17e4b18.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" /></h3>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<h3><span style=\\\"font-size:medium;\\\">Correlation</span></h3>\\n</div>\\n<div>The Coefficient of Correlation measure the linear relationship between attributes, and the value range from -1 for perfect opposite correlation to 1 for prefect correlation &#8211; where 0 indicates no correlation.</div>\\n<div><img src=\\\"/Users/Brendan/AppData/Local/Temp/EverNoteTempDir/26061-41266560b52c5f93.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" /></div>\\n<p>To use correlation in evaluating a model, one computes the correlation coefficient of the test data set and the predictions of the model.

Some basic evaluation methods and metrics are explored. Additionally, advanced techniques such as boosting and bagging may be applied to improve accuracy.</p>\\n<h3>Training data vs. Test data sets</h3>\\n<p>The concepts of having (at least) two different sets of data is fundamental to building models used in data mining. We need one set of data to use for to train the model &#8211; and we call this the training data set. We also need another set of data to evaluate a model, so that we may compare it to other models that have been built, in order to determine which is better suited for the particular analytic task.</p>\\n<p>However, these two data sets are only conceptually separate – physically, they may overlap. In a large data set, one may do a clean split such that there is a training set and a test set and there is no overlap, however, in a smaller data set, doing this would mean that there are too few in either the training or the test set to train or evaluate any meaningful model. Therefore, advanced techniques such as cross validation and bootstrapping are used to obtain the training and test sets.</p>\\n<h3>Cross validation</h3>\\n<p>Cross validation is done in a number of &#8220;folds&#8221;, and is referred to as n-fold cross validation. This diagram shows 4-fold cross validation:<br />\\n<img src=\\\"https://brendangraetz.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/cross_validation_4fold.png?w=584\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><br />\\nThe data is divided into n equal sized partitions (each row represents a partition), and each partition is split into test data and training data. When training this is no different than merely allocating a certain percentage of the data to be training data and the remaining data as test data; as is the case with the split data set that is commonly used in larger data sets. However, the significance is of this complex divisioning is that during evaluation, the accuracy of each partition is evaluated separately from the rest, and the final performance is the average of the performance in all partitions.</p>\\n<p>Bootstrapping is different from the split (AKA the partition) and cross validation, because the same data item may be sampled more than once – this is called sampling with replacement. A data set with n instances is sampled n times (with replacement) to form a training data set. Any instances that are not in the training data set form the test data set.</p>\\n<h3>Model evaluation measurements</h3>\\n<p>In evaluating a model, the simplest performance metric is to simply count the number of correct predictions out of the total number of instance. However, not only are there other performance metrics available, but to complicate things, there are also situations where this metric is not applicable, such as when the possible values are not discrete (i.e. they are real or numeric). To complicate things even further, there are situations where one may choose to discretise a numeric value, or do the inverse and convert a nominal (discrete) value to a numeric one. Thus other performance metric are needed too.</p>\\n<h4>Confusion matrix</h4>\\n<p>A confusion matrix is used to determine accuracy in a classification problem where the output is nominal. True positives and true negative are the correct predictions; false positives and false negatives are the incorrect predictions. Accuracy is (TP + TN) / (TP + TN +FP + FN).<br />\\n<img src=\\\"https://brendangraetz.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/confusion_matrix_2value.png?w=584\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><br />\\nDetermining which are TP, TN, FP &amp; FN is fairly straight forward when there are only two nominal values to be considered, as in the case of a &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; value. When there are three or more possible nominal values, it becomes trickier, as one needs to consider the TP, FP, TN &amp; FN for each nominal value separately.</p>\\n<h4>Other classification metrics</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Accuracy is (TP + TN) / (TP + TN +FP + FN)</li>\\n<li>Sensitivity is (TP) / (TP + FP)</li>\\n<li>Specificity is (TN) / (TN + FN)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Root Mean Squared Error</h4>\\n<p>RMSE is used to determine accuracy in estimation and prediction problems where the output is numerical.<br />\\n<img src=\\\"https://brendangraetz.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/rms_error_formula.png?w=584\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /><br />\\nThis is done by summing the squares of each of the error for each individual item, dividing this by the number of items, and then taking the square root of that. The effect of squaring means that outliers will have a markedly large effect on the calculated error, and additionally, the error will always be positive.</p>\\n<h3>Improving accuracy</h3>\\n<p>Ensemble methods are used to aggregate multiple models to create a composite model with improved accuracy. Bagging (AKA bootstrap aggregating) and boosting do this by aggregating models that are generated by the same learning algorithm, over different training/ test data set pairs.</p>\\n<p>Bagging replicates training sets by sampling with replacement from training instances. Boosting uses all instances, but it weights them &#8211; giving harder to classify instances higher weights, and are therefore chosen more frequently to be added to the training or test data. The resulting classifiers are then combined by voting to create a composite classifier. In bagging all classifiers have the same votes, whereas in boosting the vote is variable and based on each individual classifier&#8217;s accuracy</p>\\n<p>An explanation of the <a title=\\\"Bootstrap aggregation (bagging) algorithm\\\" href=\\\"http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/richardh/astro/index.html#par:Boosting-and-bagging:\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">bagging algorithm</a>.</p>\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/2010/04/07/play-a-game-to-solve-global-issues\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"comments\": true,\n          \"title\": \"Play a game to solve global issues\",\n          \"date\": 1270635780000,\n          \"original-url\": \"http://brendangraetz.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/play-a-game-to-solve-global-issues/\",\n          \"dateurls-override\": \"/2010/04/07/play-a-game-to-solve-global-issues/\",\n          \"tags\": [\n            \"game\",\n            \"global\",\n            \"issues\",\n            \"news\"\n          ],\n          \"source\": \"src/documents/wordpressposts/2010-04-07-play-a-game-to-solve-global-issues.html\",\n          \"url\": \"/2010/04/07/play-a-game-to-solve-global-issues\",\n          \"urlAliases\": []\n        },\n        \"body\": \"\\n<p>Came across this new game called Evoke, whose objective is to expose players to various global causes and issues* through a fun medium.

However it ran incredibly slowly. So I decided to get Jeremy Visser&#8217;s <a href=\\\"http://bit.ly/9EohCw\\\">python iView</a> instead. The problem with that is that while python is theoretically cross platform, it is extremely hard to get working on a non-Linux, non-Mac box, and especially so when the application in question has multiple 3rd party dependencies. Judging from the <a href=\\\"http://bit.ly/9EohCw\\\">comments on Jeremy&#8217;s blog</a>, I think no one has managed to get it working on Windows yet, so I am posting a how-to for the benefit of those whose primary machine is a Windows box. Note that this requires your to install nine pieces of software in total to get working, and you need to edit environment variables, etc, so it can take a while.</p>\\n<p>Full instructions after the jump. Enjoy.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Download and install the following software. The order in which they are installed is somewhat important as some are dependencies of the others.<br />\\nFor each I have provided a link to both the developer&#8217;s page, plus a direct one to the distribution file. I have specified version numbers because not all versions play nice with each other &#8211; for example if your version of python is different, you will need to get different distributions of the python libraries.<br />\\nSome software does not come with an executable installer and will actually involve manual installation that includes building the software. To do this, you will have to open up a command prompt, change directories to the location where the files are downloaded or uncompressed to, and enter the command lines detailed.<br />\\nNote that special care has been taken to avoid folder or file names containing spaces &#8211; I use a `programs` folder instead of using the default `Program Files`.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>- Python<br />\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.4/\\\">http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.4/</a><br />\\n2.6.4: <a href=\\\"http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.4/python-2.6.4.msi\\\">http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.4/python-2.6.4.msi</a><br />\\nPath should be automatically set, check it anyway</li>\\n<li>- Bazaar<br />\\n<a href=\\\"http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/WindowsDownloads\\\">http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/WindowsDownloads</a><br />\\n2.1.0-2 <a href=\\\"http://launchpad.net/bzr/2.1/2.1.0/+download/bzr-2.1.0-2-setup.exe\\\">http://launchpad.net/bzr/2.1/2.1.0/+download/bzr-2.1.0-2-setup.exe</a><br />\\nAdd bazaar to path<br />\\nPath should be automatically set, check anyway</li>\\n<li>- PyGTK group<br />\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html\\\">http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html</a></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>&#8211; PyCairo<br />\\n<a href=\\\"http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pycairo/1.8/1.8.6\\\">http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pycairo/1.8/1.8.6</a><br />\\n1.8.6 <a href=\\\"http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pycairo/1.8/pycairo-1.8.6.win32-py2.6.exe\\\">http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pycairo/1.8/pycairo-1.8.6.win32-py2.6.exe</a></li>\\n<li>&#8211;PyGObject<br />\\n<a href=\\\"http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygobject/2.20/2.20.0\\\">http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygobject/2.20/2.20.0</a><br />\\n2.20.0 <a href=\\\"http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygobject/2.20/pygobject-2.20.0.win32-py2.6.exe\\\">http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygobject/2.20/pygobject-2.20.0.win32-py2.6.exe</a></li>\\n<li>&#8211;PyGTK<br />\\n<a href=\\\"http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.16/\\\">http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.16/</a><br />\\n2.16.0 <a href=\\\"http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.16/pygtk-2.16.0+glade.win32-py2.6.exe\\\">http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.16/pygtk-2.16.0+glade.win32-py2.6.exe</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>-GTK+<br />\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html#StableRelease\\\">http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html#StableRelease</a><br />\\n2.18 <a href=\\\"http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.18/gtk+-bundle_2.18.7-20100213_win32.zip\\\">http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.18/gtk+-bundle_2.18.7-20100213_win32.zip</a><br />\\nSimply extract folder to disk<br />\\nPath must be manually set</li>\\n<li>-RTMP dump<br />\\n<a href=\\\"http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/download/\\\">http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/download/</a><br />\\n2.1d <a href=\\\"http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/download/rtmpdump-2.1d-windows.zip\\\">http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/download/rtmpdump-2.1d-windows.zip</a><br />\\nSimply extract the folder to disk<br />\\nPath must be manually set</li>\\n<li>-Beautiful Soup<br />\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/3.0.8\\\">http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/3.0.8</a><br />\\n3.0.8 <a href=\\\"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/download/3.x/BeautifulSoup-3.0.8.tar.gz\\\">http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/download/3.x/BeautifulSoup-3.0.8.tar.gz</a></p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: powershell; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\npython setup.py bdist\\ndist/BeautifulSoup-3.0.8.win32.exe\\n</pre>\\n</li>\\n<li>-Python iView<br />\\n<a href=\\\"http://jeremy.visser.name/2009/08/30/python-iview/\\\">http://jeremy.visser.name/2009/08/30/python-iview/</a><br />\\nrevision 341</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: powershell; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\ncd C:\\\\Programs\\nbzr branch http://jeremy.visser.name/bzr/python-iview/python-iview\\nnotepad setup.py\\nREM edit to remove the slashes that precede `usr` (2X)\\npython setup.py bdist\\ndist/iview-0.2.win32.exe\\n</pre>\\n</li>\\n<li>Edit the environment variable, `path` to add or update these values:\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: powershell; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\nC:\\\\Programs\\\\python264;\\nC:\\\\Programs\\\\Bazaar;\\nC:\\\\Programs\\\\gtk\\\\bin;\\nC:\\\\Programs\\\\rtmpdump-2.1d\\n</pre>\\n<p>These values must be added to the `path`.

This is useful when one wants to record &#8220;live&#8221; information such as transactions or logs. However, when one wants to mine the data for analytical purposes &#8211; for example, which time window of the day are the most sales made &#8211; and you want to do this over an extremely large data set &#8211; how should this be done? It is possible to construct a somewhat complex query to get the answer, but in cases such as these, the way in which the data warehouse is structured is optimised to obtain such information. However, before that is done, the operational data first needs to be transformed and put into a data warehouse.</p>\\n<h2>Transformation SQL</h2>\\n<p>I will not go into detail about the planning steps here, and instead will get right into the steps necessary to achieve the transformation.</p>\\n<h3>1. Create the dimension tables</h3>\\n<p>There are 3 ways to create dimension tables:</p>\\n<p>i) Copy a table wholesale from the operational database. This can be done for some tables, which fit the bill of the dimension tables &#8211; they usually have the same name as the identified dimension, plus the attributes identified for the dimension are the columns in this table in the operational database.</p>\\n<p>ii) Create tables from scratch, manually inserting values. This is done for dimensions which do not exist in the operational database at all. For example a time of day dimension for data that should be sliced according to morning, afternoon or night. In most operational databases, the tables will not have columns that have this information about a time/ date value (at least in normalised ones).</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: sql; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">Create Table periodDim --create a period dimension table\\n(period_id Number,\\nperiod_desc Varchar(20));\\nInsert Into periodDim Values (1, 'Summer');\\nInsert Into periodDim Values (2, 'Autumn');\\nInsert Into periodDim Values (3, 'Winter');\\nInsert Into periodDim Values (4, 'Spring');</pre>\\n<p>iii) Extract values from a operational database table using `Select Distinct`. This is done when the data exists in some form in the operational data, however, cannot be used as-is, and must be extracted in a special manner. This occurs in the converse situation as in (ii), where data could have been potentially further normalised, however values were used directly.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: sql; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">Create Table source_dim\\nAs (Select Distinct\\nDense_Rank() Over (Order By o.order_source) As source_id,\\no.order_source As source_desc\\nFrom op_db.order o);</pre>\\n<p>Note that here the `Dense_Rank() Over`, which is normally used for OLAP purposes, is used here to perform the simple function of assigning unique primary keys for this dimension table. Why `Dense_Rank` instead of `Rank`? You could really use either without issue, just that `Dense_Rank` will give running numbers without gaps, whereas, `Rank` would result in gaps, as a result of being used together with `Distinct`.</p>\\n<h3>2. Create a temporary fact table</h3>\\n<p>There are two main steps to this: First create the actual table by joining the necessary tables from the operational database. Secondly, create the links from the fact table to the dimension tables.</p>\\n<p>i) The first step is a simple join. Select all the attributes that are needed to obtain the attributes in the fact table. This would include the values that are needed to determine how it relates to each dimension, plus any of the &#8220;fact&#8221; attributes, which are usually aggregate values. &#8220;Aggregate&#8221; used here refers to a single figure that represents are larger set of figures: sum, count, average, minimum, maximum, etc.</p>\\n<p>ii) The next step is to add columns for the primary keys of the dimension tables. For example, the temp table may already have a &#8220;purchase date&#8221; column, and your dimension table has four entries, one for each season of the year. There are two ways to do this:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: sql; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">--manually insert the period IDs\\nUpdate temp Set period_id=1 --summer\\nWhere (to_char(order_date, 'MON') In ('DEC', 'JAN', 'FEB'));\\nUpdate temp Set period_id=2 --autumn\\nWhere (to_char(order_date, 'MON') In ('MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'));\\nUpdate temp Set period_id=3 --winter\\nWhere (to_char(order_date, 'MON') In ('JUN', 'JUL', 'AUG'));\\nUpdate temp Set period_id=4 --spring\\nWhere (to_char(order_date, 'MON') In ('SEP', 'OCT', 'NOV'));\\n</pre>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: sql; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">--automatically parse period IDs\\nUpdate temp t\\nSet t.period_id=(\\nSelect pd.period_id\\nFrom periodDim pd\\nWhere ((to_date(to_char(t.order_date, 'MMDD'), 'MMDD') &amp;lt;= pd.end_date) And\\n(to_date(to_char(t.order_date, 'MMDD'), 'MMDD') &amp;gt;= pd.start_date)\\n);</pre>\\n<p>Note that the latter involves an additional step where the &#8220;start_date&#8221; and &#8220;end_date&#8221; columns are defined for the period dimension table. In this case, since there are a finite number of seasons (four), there is a choice &#8211; either method will work fine. However, when there is a theoretically infinite number of possible entries in a dimension table, or if there is a finite but unmanageably large number of such entries, then the latter method is the only practical way to do this.</p>\\n<p>Also, note that I have converted a date type to a string, and then back again to a date type &#8211; this has been done on purpose to scrub the date values such that only their month and day values are used. Otherwise, you would be comparing apples to oranges.</p>\\n<h3>3. Create the fact table from the template</h3>\\n<p>This is the easiest step of them all (including the planning steps), because if everything has been done right up until now, then this is trivial. However, if something has not quite gone right in the previous steps, this is probably where you will notice and then have to backtrack. We just copy the fact table, but instead of select all columns, we select only the relevant ones (identified in the star schema). These should be the primary keys of the dimension tables, plus the aggregate values that are the facts being presented by the fact table.</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"brush: sql; title: ; notranslate\\\" title=\\\"\\\">Create Table fact\\nAs (\\nSelect Count(t.cust_id) As num_cust, --aggregate values\\nCount(t.order_id) As num_order,\\nSum(t.item_price * t.order_qty) As order_cost,\\nt.source_id, t.period_id, t.locationi_d -- the PK's of the dimension table\\nFrom temp t\\nGroup By t.source_id, t.period_id, t.location_id -- group by ALL of the non-aggregate values\\n);</pre>\\n<h2>A note on PKs and FKs</h2>\\n<p>Primary keys and foreign keys are necessary in operational database because, in addition to them being normalised, they need to support all four types of operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete). Whereas, in a data warehouse, that is not the case &#8211; after creation, a data warehouse should only be used for Read operations.</p>\\n\"\n      },\n      \"/2010/03/25/do-programmers-need-math-skills\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"layout\": \"post\",\n          \"comments\": true,\n          \"title\": \"Do programmers need math skills?\",\n          \"date\": 1269505560000,\n          \"original-url\": \"http://brendangraetz.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/do-programmers-need-math-skills/\",\n          \"dateurls-override\": \"/2010/03/25/do-programmers-need-math-skills/\",\n          \"tags\": [\n            \"news\"\n          ],\n          \"source\": \"src/documents/wordpressposts/2010-03-25-do-programmers-need-math-skills.html\",\n          \"url\": \"/2010/03/25/do-programmers-need-math-skills\",\n          \"urlAliases\": []\n        },\n        \"body\": \"\\n<p>Alan Skorkin writes about why he thinks <a title=\\\"You Don’t Need Math Skills To Be A Good Developer But You Do Need Them To Be A Great One\\\" href=\\\"bit.ly/ciKlbF\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">mathematical skills are necessary to be a good developer</a>.</p>\\n<p>Was some food for thought indeed.
