=SPEAKERNOTES=

I came across an O'Rly "definitive guide" parody book cover generator,
and I couldn't resist making one for this presentation.

But this is in no way the defintiev guide to anything,
so just ignore this really

This talk is pretty much a quick overview

Frameworks vs Libraries

![Frameworks vs Libraries furniture analogy](img/frameworks-vs-libraries.png)

=SPEAKERNOTES=

Let's start off with furniture.
You can get your furniture all sorts of different ways.

On one end of the spectrum,
you can have blocks of wood/ metal/ etc,
and literally cut them up into pieces and make your own table.
This is like using neither a framework nor a library.

On the other end of the spectrum,
you can have the entire table pre-made.
All you have to do is buy it,
and you decide where to put it,
and perhaps what to put on it.
This is like using a framework.

Somewhere in the middle,
you have something like Ikea,
where you buy the pieces that you need to make your table,
and you get to put them together exactly like the instructions say...
but you have some room for creativity.
This is like using a library.

![Ikea bookshelf that became a shoerack](ikea-bookshelf-that-became-a-shoerack.png)

=SPEAKERNOTES=

It was actually a bookshelf from Ikea,
and I bought a couple of extra wooden boards,
and threw out the back board.
Now it's a shoe rack,
and it fit my needs way better than
any of the shoe racks I could find out there.
I don't have the carpentry skills good enough to put together anything really.
But given some pre-made parts I was able to make my own thing.

A framework **calls** your code

*vs*

A library is **called by** your code

=SPEAKERNOTES=

This to me is what the distinction between a framework and a library is:
who calls who.

![ReactJs EmberJs AngularJs](img/reactjs-emberjs-angularjs.png)

=SPEAKERNOTES=

Therein also lies, IMHO,
the main distinction between ReactJs and its competition,
such as AngularJs and EmberJs:
ReactJs is a library, whereas EmberJs and AngularJs are frameworks.

=SPEAKERNOTES=

So this is a talk about publishing websites using ReactJs,
why wax all this software engineering philosophy,
you might be thinking?

![Screenshots of other ReactJs static site generators](img/screenshots-of-other-reactjs-static)

=SPEAKERNOTES=

Here's why.  When I was looking for static site generators,
I found that there were already a couple of
really popular, ReactJs based, site gens out there.

But, when I looked through their code,
I found that they were actually frameworks themselves.

Then I found this webpack plugin,
